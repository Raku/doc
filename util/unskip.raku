=begin overview

Many examples in the docs are tagged with :skip-test. This utility
checks to see if the code can be run with our usual tester, and if
that fails, with the C<:solo> attribute; If either of these work,
the file is modified in place, allowing the developer to inspect
the changes to the C<doc/> directory and commit the updated files.

This utility will also attempt to remove C<:solo>'s from tests that
are being run; sometimes the attribute is copied unecessarily to a
new test. Because it's longer to run the test with this attribute,
we want to avoid it if possible.

As with C<xt/> tests, you can limit the files checked with the
C<TEST_FILES> environment variable or by passing the named files as arguments

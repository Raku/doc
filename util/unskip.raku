=begin overview

Many examples in the docs are tagged with :skip-test. This utility
checks to see if the code can be run with our usual tester, and if
that fails, with the C<:solo> attribute; If either of these work,
the file is modified in place, allowing the developer to inspect
the changes to the C<doc/> directory and commit the updated files.

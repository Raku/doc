    class Iterable is Cool { }

C<Iterable> serves as a superclass for objects that can be iterated with the
C<for> construct and related iteration constructs.

C<Iterable> objects nested in other C<Iterable> objects (but not within scalar
containers) flatten in certain contexts, for example when iterated with a
C<for> loop, or on list assignment.

=SUBTITLE Compilation error due to composing an uneligible type

    class X::Composition::NotComposable is Exception { }

Thrown when trying to compose a type into a target type, but the composer type
cannot be used for composition (roles and enums are generally OK).

For example

    class A { }
    class B does A { }

dies with

    ===SORRY!===
    ␤A is not composable, so B cannot compose it

because C<does> is reserved for role composition, and C<A> is not a role,
nor something that knows how to turn into a role.

The fix is to either make C<A> a role, or use inheritance
(C<class B is A { }>) instead.

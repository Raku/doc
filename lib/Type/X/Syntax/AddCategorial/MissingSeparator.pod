=SUBTITLE Compilation error due to declaring a circumfix operator without
          separating oper and closer

    class X::Syntax::AddCategorial::MissingSeparator does X::Syntax { }

Syntax error when a circumfix operator is defined, but within the definition
opening and closing terminators are not separated by a whitespace.

For example

    multi sub circumfix:<⌊⌋>($a) { return $a.floor; }

dies with

    ===SORRY!===
    Unable to identify both starter and stopper from ⌊⌋
    Perhaps you forgot to separate them with whitespace?

Valid code would contain an extra whitespace:

    multi sub circumfix:<⌊ ⌋>($a) { return $a.floor; }
    my $n = ⌊4.9⌋;  ## $n is now 4

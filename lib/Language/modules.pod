=SUBTITLE How to create, use and distribute Perl 6 modules

=head1 Creating and Using Modules

A module is usually a source file or set of source filesN<Technically
a module is a set of I<compunits> which are usually files but could
come from anywhere as long as there is a I<compunit repository> that
can provide it. See L<S11|http://design.perl6.org/S11.html>.> that
expose Perl 6 constructs. These are typically packages
(L<classes|/language/objects#Classes>,
L<roles|/language/objects#Roles>, L<grammars|Grammar>),
L<subroutines|/language/functions>, and sometimes
L<variables|/language/variables>. In Perl 6 I<module> can also refer
to a type of package declared with the C<module> keyword (see example
below) but here we mostly mean "module" as a set of source
files in a namespace.

=head2 Basic Structure

Module distributions in Perl 6 have the same stucture as any distribution in
the Perl family of languages:  there is a main project directory containing
a C<README> and C<LICENSE> file, a C<lib> directory for modules, a C<t>
directory for tests, and possibly a C<bin> directory for executable programs
and scripts.

Module files generally use the standard C<.pm> extension, and scripts or
executables use C<.pl>.  However, if you wish to highlight that the file is
written in Perl 6 you can use the C<.pm6> extension for modules, and the
C<.p6> extension for scripts.  Test files still use the normal C<.t>
extension.

=head2 Loading and Basic Importing

Loading a module makes the packages declared within available in the
package scope of the loader. Importing from a module makes the symbols
exported available in the current lexical scope.

    # loads at compile time
    need MyModule;

    # loads and imports default symbols at compile time
    use MyModule;

    # imports default symbols at compile time
    import MyModule;

    # loads module at runtime
    require MyModule;

    #declares &foo at compile time in the lexical scope
    #loads module at runtime
    #binds &foo at runtime to the exported symbol
    require MyModule <&foo>

    #the same but with the module name in runtime variable
    my $var = 'MyModule';
    require ::($var) <&foo>;

=head2 Exporting and Selective Importing

Subroutines, variables, constants and enums are exported by marking
them with the L<is export> trait.

    =begin code
    unit module MyModule;
    our $var is export = 3;
    sub foo is export { ... };
    constant $FOO is export = "foobar";
    enum FooBar is export (:baz(1));

    #'is export' is not for packages
    class MyModule::Class {}
    =end code

You can pass parameters to C<is export> to group symbols for exporting
then the importer can pick and choose. There are three predefined
tags: C<ALL>, C<DEFAULT> and C<MANDATORY>.

    =begin code
    # lib/MyModule.pm
    unit module MyModule;
    sub bag        is export             { ... }
    sub pants      is export(:MANDATORY) { ... }
    sub sunglasses is export(:day)       { ... }
    sub torch      is export(:night)     { ... }
    sub underpants is export(:ALL)       { ... }
    =end code

    =begin code
    # main.pl
    use lib 'lib';
    use MyModule;          #pants, bag
    use MyModule :DEFAULT; #the same
    use MyModule :day;     #pants, sunglasses
    use MyModule :night;   #pants, torch
    use MyModule :ALL;     #pants, sunglasses, torch, underpants
    =end code

=head2 EXPORT

You can export arbitrary symbols with an C<EXPORT> sub. C<EXPORT>
must return a L<EnumMap>, where the keys are the symbol names and
the values are the desired values. The names should include the sigil
(if any) for the associated type.

    =begin code
    # lib/MyModule.pm

    class MyModule::Class { ... }

    sub EXPORT {
        {
         '$var'   => 'one',
         '@array' => <one two three>,
         '%hash'  => { one => 'two', three => 'four' },
         '&doit'   => sub { ... },
         'ShortName' => MyModule::Class
        }
    }
    =end code

    =begin code
    # main.pl
    use lib 'lib';
    use MyModule;
    say $var;
    say @array;
    say %hash;
    doit();
    say ShortName.new; #MyModule::Class.new
    =end code

Note, C<EXPORT> can't be declared inside a package because
presently rakudo (2015.06) seems to treat C<EXPORT> as part of the
compunit rather than the package.

If you pass positional parameters to C<use> they will be passed to
C<EXPORT>. The module no longer exports default symbols if a
positional is passed, however you may still import them explicitly by
passing :C<DEFAULT> to C<use>.

    =begin code
    # lib/MyModule

    class MyModule::Class {}

    sub EXPORT($short_name?) {
        {
          do $short_name => MyModule::Class if $short_name
        }
    }

    sub always is export(:MANDATORY) { say "works" }

    #import with :ALL or :DEFAULT to get
    sub shy is export { say "you found me!" }
    =end code

    =begin code
    # main.pl
    use lib 'lib';
    use MyModule 'foo';
    say foo.new(); #MyModule::Class.new
    always();      #OK   - is imported
    shy();         #FAIL - won't be imported
    =end code

=head1 Distributing Modules

If you've written a Perl 6 module and would like to share it with the
community, we'd be delighted to have it listed in the L<Perl 6 modules
directory|http://modules.perl6.org>. C<:)>

For now, the process requires that you use git for your module's version
control.

The instructions herein require that you have a
L<GitHub|http://www.github.com> account so that your module can be shared
from its GitHub repository.

To share your module, do the following:

    =item Create a project directory named after your module. For
    example, if your module is C<Vortex::TotalPerspective>, then create a
    project directory named C<Vortex-TotalPerspective>. This project
    directory name will also be used as the GitHub repo name.

    =begin item
    Make your project directory look like this:

        Vortex-TotalPerspective/
        |-- lib
        |   `-- Vortex
        |       `-- TotalPerspective.pm
        |-- LICENSE
        |-- META.info
        |-- README.md
        `-- t
            `-- basic.t

    If your project contains other modules that help the main module do
    its job, they should go in your lib directory like so:

        lib
        `-- Vortex
            |-- TotalPerspective.pm
            `-- TotalPerspective
                |-- FairyCake.pm
                `-- Gargravarr.pm
    =end item

    =item The C<README.md> file is a L<markdown-formatted|https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/> text file, which
    will later be automatically rendered as HTML by GitHub.

    =item Regarding the C<LICENSE> file, if you have no other preference,
    you might just use the same one that Rakudo Perl 6 uses. Just
    copy/paste the raw form of L<its license|https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/LICENSE>
    into your own C<LICENSE> file.

    =item If you don't yet have any tests, you can leave out the C<t>
    directory and C<basic.t> file for now. For more info on how to write
    tests (for now), you might have a look at how other modules use
    C<Test>. It's quite similar to Perl 5's C<Test::More>.

    =item To document your modules, use L<Perl 6 Pod |
    http://design.perl6.org/S26.html> markup inside your modules. Module
    documentation is most appreciated and will be especially important once
    the Perl 6 module directory (or some other site) begins rendering Pod docs
    as HTML for easy browsing.
    N«
        Note, described above is a minimal project directory. If your project
        contains scripts that you'd like distributed along with your module(s),
        put them in a C<bin> directory. If you have extra docs (in addition to the
        Pod docs in your module(s)), create a C<doc> directory for them. If you'd
        like a graphical logo to appear next to your module at the module
        directory, create a C<logotype> directory and put into it a C<logo_32x32.png>
        file. At some point, you might also consider adding C<CONTRIBUTORS>, C<NEWS>,
        C<TODO>, or other files.
    »

    =begin item
    Make your C<META.info> file look something like this:

    =for code :allow<R>
    {
        "name" : "Vortex::TotalPerspective",
        "version" : "0.1.0",
        "description" : "Wonderful simulation to get some perspective.",
        "author" : "R<Your Name>",
        "provides" : {
            "Vortex::TotalPerspective" : "lib/Vortex/TotalPerspective.pm"
        },
        "depends" : [ ],
        "source-url" : "git://github.com/R<you>/Vortex-TotalPerspective.git"
    }

    For choosing a version numbering scheme, perhaps use
    "major.minor.patch" (see L<the spec on versioning |
    http://design.perl6.org/S11.html#Versioning> for further
    details). If the version number doesn't matter to you or your users
    right now, you can just put in an asterisk (*) for the version.

    In C<provides> section, include all the namespaces provided by
    your distribution.

    =end item

    =item Put your project under git version control if you haven't done so
    already.

    =item Once you're happy with your project, create a repo for it at GitHub.
    See L<GitHub's help docs|https://help.github.com/> if necessary. Your
    GitHub repo should be named the same as your project directory. Immediately
    after creating the GitHub repo, GitHub shows you how to configure your
    local repo to know about your GitHub repo.

    =item Push your project to GitHub.

    =item Ping someone on IRC (#perl6 at freenode) to either show you how to
    add your module to the L<ecosystem|https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem>, or
    else ask them if they could please add it for you.

B<That's it! Thanks for contributing to the Perl 6 community!>

If you'd like to try out installing your module, use the panda module
installer tool which is included with Rakudo Star Perl 6:

=code panda install Vortex::TotalPerspective

This will download your module to its own working directory (C<~/.panda>),
build it there, and install the module into C<~/.perl6>.

To use C<Vortex::TotalPerspective> from your scripts, just write
C<use Vortex::TotalPerspective>, and your Perl 6 implementation will
know where to look for the module file(s).

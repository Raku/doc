=head1 Operator Precedence

In an expression like C<1 + 2 * 3>, the C<2 * 3> is evaluated first
because the infix C<*> has tighter B<precedence> than the C<+>.

The following table summarizes the precedence levels in Perl 6, from
tightest to loosest:

=begin table

    A  Level             Examples
    =  =====             ========
    N  Terms             42 3.14 "eek" qq["foo"] $x :!verbose @$array
    L  Method postfix    .meth .+ .? .* .() .[] .{} .<> .«» .:: .= .^ .:

    L  Multiplicative    * / % %% +& +< +> ~& ~< ~> ?& div mod gcd lcm
    L  Additive          + - +| +^ ~| ~^ ?| ?^

    N  Terminator        ; {...}, unless, extra ), ], }

=end table

Using two C<!> symbols below generically to represent any pair of operators
that have the same precedence, the associativities specified above
for binary operators are interpreted as follows:

=begin table

    A   Assoc     Meaning of $a ! $b ! $c
    =   =====     =======================
    L   left      ($a ! $b) ! $c
    R   right     $a ! ($b ! $c)
    N   non       ILLEGAL
    C   chain     ($a ! $b) and ($b ! $c)
    X   list      infix:<!>($a; $b; $c)

=end table

For unaries this is interpreted as:


=begin table

    A   Assoc     Meaning of !$a!
    =   =====     =========================
    L   left      (!$a)!
    R   right     !($a!)
    N   non       ILLEGAL

=end table


=head1 Operator classification

Operators can occur in several positions relative to a term:

=begin table

    +term           prefix
    term1 + term2   infix
    term++          postfix
    (term)          circumfix
    term1[term2]    postcircumfix

=end table

Each operator is also available as a routine; postcircumfix operators as
methods, all others as subroutines. The name of the routine is formed of
the operator category, then a colon, and a list quote construct with the
symbol(s) that make up the operator:

    infix:<+>(1, 2)                 # same as 1 + 2
    circumfix:«( )»('a', 'b', 'c')  # same as ('a', 'b', 'c')

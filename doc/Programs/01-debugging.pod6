=TITLE Debugging

=SUBTITLE Debug Perl 6 programs

There are at least two useful debuggers available for Rakudo, the Perl 6 compiler:

=item L<Debugger::UI::CommandLine|https://modules.perl6.org/repo/Debugger::UI::CommandLine>

A command-line debugger frontend for Rakudo.

=item L<Grammar::Debugger|https://modules.perl6.org/repo/Grammar::Debugger> (and C<Grammar::Tracer> in the same distribution)

Simple tracing and debugging support for Perl 6 grammars.

Please see the documentation for these programs for further information.

Historically others have existed and others are likely to be written in the future,
check the L<Perl 6 Modules|https://modules.perl6.org/> website.

There are also environment variables that can be set to aid debugging
various aspects of your program.  See L<Perl 6 Environment
Variables|https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/dev-env-vars> and
L<Running rakudo from the command
line|https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Running-rakudo-from-the-command-line>
for more information.

=head2 C<trace> pragma

The C<trace> pragma causes the program to print out step-by-step which lines
get executed:

    use trace;
    sub foo { say "hi" }
    foo;

    # OUTPUT:
    # 2 (/tmp/script.p6 line 2)
    # sub foo { say "hi" }
    # 5 (/tmp/script.p6 line 3)
    # foo
    # 3 (/tmp/script.p6 line 2)
    # say "hi"
    # hi

=head2 Dumper function C<dd>

X<|dd> X<|dumper>

B<Note:> this routine is a Rakudo-specific debugging feature and not standard
Perl 6.

The Tiny Data Dumper: This function takes the input list of variables and
C<note>s them (on C<$*ERR>) in an easy to read format, along with the
C<name> of the variable.  Thus,

=begin code :ok-test<dd>
my $a = 42;
my %hash = "a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3;

dd %hash, $a;
#`( OUTPUT:
    Hash %hash = {:a(1), :b(2), :c(3)}
    Int $a = 42
)
=end code

to the standard error stream.

Please note that C<dd> will ignore named parameters. You can use a C<Capture>
or C<Array> to force it to dump everything passed to it.

=begin code :ok-test<dd>
dd \((:a(1), :b(2)), :c(3));
dd [(:a(1), :b(2)), :c(3)];
=end code

If you don't specify any parameters at all, it will just print the type and
name of the current subroutine / method to the standard error stream:

=begin code :ok-test<dd>
sub a { dd }; a   # OUTPUT: «sub a()␤»
=end code

This can be handy as a cheap trace function.

=head2 Using backtraces

The L<Backtrace> class gets the current call stack, and can return it as a
string:

    my $trace = Backtrace.new;
    sub inner { say ~Backtrace.new; }
    sub outer { inner; }
    outer;

    # OUTPUT:
    # perl6 /tmp/script.p6
    #   in sub inner at /tmp/script.p6 line 2
    #   in sub outer at /tmp/script.p6 line 3
    #   in block <unit> at /tmp/script.p6 line 4

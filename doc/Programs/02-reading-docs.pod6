=SUBTITLE p6doc - the Perl 6 pod reader

=head1 X<INTRODUCTION|p6doc>

Program C<p6doc> is a command-line-interface (CLI) program that reads
Perl 6 pod from B<installed> modules' source code, in contrast to
running C<perl6 --doc=MODULE programfile> which reads Perl 6 pod from
the named source file.

Note that C<p6doc> may not be installed automatically depending upon
how you installed Rakudo Perl 6.  To install it use C<zef>:

=for code :lang<usage>
zef install p6doc

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for code :lang<usage>
p6doc [switches] [arguments]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

With no switches or arguments, C<p6doc> lists its help to C<$*OUT> (C<stdout>):

=begin code :skip-test
You want to maintain the index?
To build an index for 'p6doc -f'
          p6doc build

To list the index keys
          p6doc list

To display module name(s) containing key
          p6doc lookup

To show where the index file lives
          p6doc path-to-index

What documentation do you want to read?
Examples: p6doc Str
          p6doc Str.split
          p6doc faq
          p6doc path/to/file

You can list some top level documents:
          p6doc -l

You can also look up specific method/routine/sub definitions:
          p6doc -f hyper
          p6doc -f Array.push

You can bypass the pager and print straight to stdout:
          p6doc -n Str
=end code

The text output can be captured and converted to other forms if desired.

If you want to use ANSI escape sequences, which will apply boldface
and other enhancements to the output, you will have to set
POD_TO_TEXT_ANSI, which is unset by default

=for code :lang<shell>
export POD_TO_TEXT_ANSI=1


=head1 LIMITATIONS

Currently C<p6doc> can only extract embedded Perl 6 pod from installed
module source files (as listed in a distribution's C<META6.json>
file).  It is planned to add a feature for C<p6doc> (in conjunction
with C<META6.json> changes) to extract B<all> Perl 6 pod in files
included with the installed distribution.

=end pod

=TITLE Terms

=SUBTITLE Perl 6 terms

Most syntactic constructs in Perl 6 can be categorized in I<terms> and
L<operators|/language/operators>.

Here you can find an overview of different kinds of terms.

=head1 Literals

=head2 Int

=begin code :skip-test
42
12_300_00
:16<DEAD_BEEF>
=end code

L<Int|/type/Int> literals consist of digits and can contain underscores
between any two digits.

To specify a base other than ten, use the colonpair form C<< :radix<number> >>.

=head2 Rat

    =begin code :skip-test
    12.34
    1_200.345_678
    =end code

L<Rat|/type/Rat> literals (rational numbers) contain two integer parts joined by
a dot.

Note that trailing dots are not allowed, so you have to write C<1.0> instead
of C<1.> (this rule is important because there are infix operators starting
with a dot, for example the C<..> L<Range|/type/Range> operator).

=head2 Num

=begin code :skip-test
12.3e-32
3e8
=end code

L<Num|/type/Num> literals (floating point numbers) consist of L<Rat|/type/Rat>
or L<Int|/type/Int> literals followed by an C<e> and a (possibly negative)
exponent. C<3e8> constructs a L<Num|/type/Num> with value C<3 * 10**8>.

=head2 Str

=begin code :skip-test
'a string'
'I\'m escaped!'
"I don't need to be"
"\"But I still can be,\" he said."
q|Other delimiters can be used too!|
=end code

String literals are most often created with C<'> or C<">, however strings are
actually a powerful sub-language of Perl 6. See
L<Quoting Constructs|/language/quoting>.

=head2 Regex

=begin code :skip-test
/ match some text /
rx/slurp \s rest (.*) $/
=end code

These forms produce regex literals. See L<quoting constructs|/language/quoting>.

=head2 Pair

    =begin code :skip-test
    a => 1
    'a' => 'b'
    :identifier
    :!identifier
    :identifier<value>
    :identifier<value1 value2>
    :identifier($value)
    :identifier['val1', 'val2']
    :identifier{key1 => 'val1', key2 => 'value2'}
    :valueidentifier
    :$item
    :@array
    :%hash
    :&callable
    =end code

L<Pair|/type/Pair> objects can be created either with C<< infix:«=>» >> (which
auto-quotes the left-hand side if it is an identifier), or with the various
colon-pair forms. Those almost always start with a colon and then are followed
either by an identifier or the name of an already existing variable (whose
name without the sigil is used as the key and value of the variable is used
as the value of the pair). There is a special form where an integer value
is immediately after the colon and the key is immediately after the value.

In the identifier form of a colon-pair, the optional value can be any
circumfix.  If it is left blank, the value is C<Bool::True>. The value of
the C<:!identifier> form is C<Bool::False>.

If used in an argument list, all of these forms count as named arguments,
with the exception of C<< 'quoted string' => $value >>.

=head2 List

    =begin code :skip-test
    ()
    1, 2, 3
    <a b c>
    «a b c»
    qw/a b c/
    =end code

L<List|/type/List> literals are: the empty pair of parentheses C<()>, a
comma-separated list, or several quoting constructs.

=head2 term *

Creates an object of type C<Whatever>. See L<Whatever|/type/Whatever>
documentation for more details.

=head1 Identifier terms

There are built-in identifier terms in Perl 6, which are listed below.  In
addition one can add new identifier terms with the syntax:

    sub term:<forty-two> { 42 };
    say forty-two

or as constants:

    constant forty-two = 42;
    say forty-two;

=head2 term self

Inside a method, C<self> refers to the invocant (i.e. the object the method
was called on). If used in a context where it doesn't make sense, a
compile-time exception of type L<X::Syntax::NoSelf> is thrown.

=head2 term now

Returns an L<Instant|/type/Instant> object representing the current time. It
includes L<leap seconds|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second> and as such a
few dozen seconds larger than L<time|/language/terms#term_time>:

    say (now - time).Int; # OUTPUT: «37␤»

=head2 term time

Returns the current POSIX time as an L<Int|/type/Int>. See
L<now|/language/terms#term_now> for high-resolution timestamp that includes
L<leap seconds|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second>.

=head2 term rand

Returns a pseudo-random L<Num|/type/Num> in the range C<0..^1>.

=head2 term π

Returns the number C<π>, i.e., the ratio between circumference and diameter
of a circle. The ASCII equivalent of C<π> is C<pi>.

=head2 term pi

Returns the number C<π>, i.e., the ratio between circumference and diameter
of a circle. C<pi> is the ASCII equivalent of C<π>.

=head2 term τ

Returns the number C<τ>, i.e., the ratio between circumference and radius
of a circle. The ASCII equivalent of C<τ> is C<tau>.

=head2 term tau

Returns the number C<τ>, i.e., the ratio between circumference and radius
of a circle. C<tau> is the ASCII equivalent of C<τ>.

=head2 term 𝑒

Returns Euler's number.  The ASCII equivalent of C<𝑒> is C<e>.

=head2 term e

Returns Euler's number.  C<e> is the ASCII equivalent of C<𝑒>.

=head2 term i

Returns the imaginary unit (for L<Complex|/type/Complex> numbers).

=head1 Variables

Variables are discussed in the L<variable language docs |/language/variables>.

X<|constant (Terms)>
=head1 Constants

Constants are similar to L<variables|/language/variables> without a
L<container|/language/containers>, and thus cannot be rebound. However,
their initializers are evaluated at L<BEGIN|/syntax/%20BEGIN> time:

    constant speed-of-light = 299792458; # m/s
    constant @foo  = 1, 2, 3;
    constant &talk = &say;
    talk speed-of-light²; # OUTPUT: «89875517873681764␤»
    talk @foo;            # OUTPUT: «(1 2 3)␤»

Compile-time evaluation means
L<you should be careful|/language/traps#Constants_are_Compile_Time>
with using constants
inside modules, which get automatically precompiled, and so the value
of the constant would not change even between multiple executions of the
program:

=begin code :solo
# Foo.pm6
unit module Foo;
constant comp-time = DateTime.now;
=end code

    =begin code :lang<shell>
    # The value of the constant remains the same even though our script
    # is executed multiple times:
    $ perl6 -I. -MFoo -e 'say Foo::comp-time'
    2018-06-17T18:18:50.021484-04:00
    $ perl6 -I. -MFoo -e 'say Foo::comp-time'
    2018-06-17T18:18:50.021484-04:00
    =end code

Constants are declared with keyword C<constant> followed by
an L<identifier|/language/syntax#Identifiers> with an I<optional> sigil.
Constants are L«C<our> scoped|/language/variables#The_our_declarator»
by default.

=begin code
    constant foo  = 42;
my  constant $baz = rand;
our constant @foo = 1, 2, 3;
    constant %bar = %(:42foo, :100bar);
=end code

I<NOTE: if you're using the Rakudo compiler, you need version 2018.08 or
newer for type constraints and auto-coercion on constants to be
available. Auto-coercion on %-sigiled constants requires 6.d>

An optional type constraint can be used, in which case the use
of scope declarator is required:

=begin code :skip-test<showcasing deliberate syntax error>
# !!WRONG!! missing scope declarator before type:
Int constant bar = 42;

# RIGHT:
our Int constant bar = 42;
=end code

Unlike L<variables|/language/variables>, you cannot parameterize C<@>-,
C<%>-, and C<&>-sigiled constants by specifying the parameterization
type in the declarator itself:

    =begin code :skip-test<showcasing deliberate compile-time error>
    # !!WRONG!! cannot parameterize @-sigiled constant with Int
    our Int constant @foo = 42;

    # OK: parameterized types as values are fine
    constant @foo = Array[Int].new: 42;
    =end code

The reason for the restriction is that constants with C<@> and C<%>
sigils default to L<List|/type/List> and L<Map|/type/Map> types, which cannot be
parameterized. To keep things simple and consistent, parameterization
was simply disallowed in these constructs.

The C<@>-, C<%>-, and C<&>-sigiled constants specify implied typecheck
of the given value for L<Positional|/type/Positional>, L<Associative|/type/Associative>, and L<Callable|/type/Callable>
roles respectively. The C<@>-sigiled constants—and as of C<6.d>
language version, the C<%>-sigiled constants as well—perform
auto-coercion of the value if it does not pass the implied typecheck.
The C<@>-sigiled constants will coerce using method L<cache|/routine/cache> and
C<%>-sigiled constants coerce using method L<Map|/type/Map>.

    =begin code
    constant @foo = 42;
    @foo.perl.say; # OUTPUT: «(42,)»

    constant @bar = [<a b c>];
    @bar.perl.say; # OUTPUT: «["a", "b", "c"]»
    =end code

    =begin code :solo
    use v6.d.PREVIEW;
    constant %foo = <foo bar>;
    %foo.perl.say; # OUTPUT: «Map.new((:foo("bar")))»

    constant %bar = {:10foo, :72bar};
    %bar.perl.say; # OUTPUT: «{:bar(72), :foo(10)}»

    # Pair is already Associative, so it remains a Pair
    constant %baz = :72baz;
    %baz.perl.say; # OUTPUT: «:baz(72)»
    =end code

For convenience and consistency reasons, you can use the
L«binding operator (C<:=>)|/routine/:=» instead of the assignment operator,
use backslash before sigilless name of the constant variable (same as with
L<sigilless variables|/language/variables#Sigilless_variables>), and even
omit the name of the constant entirely to have an anonymous constant. Since
you can't refer to anonymous entities, you may be better off using
a L«C<BEGIN> phaser|/language/phasers#BEGIN» instead, for clarity.

    constant %foo := :{:42foo};
    constant \foo = 42;
    constant = 'anon';

=SUBTITLE Writing and running tests in Perl 6


Testing code is an integral part of software development. Tests provide
automated, repeatable verifications of code behavior, and ensures your
code works as expected.

In Perl 6, the L<Test|/type/Test> module provides a testing framework, used also by
Perl 6's official spectest suite.

The testing functions emit output conforming to the L<Test Anything Protocol|https://testanything.org>. In general, they are used in sink context:

=for code :preamble<my ($meta,$relaxed-name); sub check-name($meta,:$relaxed-name){}>
ok check-name($meta, :$relaxed-name), "name has a hyphen rather than '::'"

but all functions also return as a Boolean if the test has been successful or not, which can be used to print a message if the test fails:

=begin code :preamble<my ($meta,$relaxed-name); sub check-name($meta,:$relaxed-name){}>
ok check-name($meta, :$relaxed-name), "name has a hyphen rather than '::'" \
  or diag "\nTo use hyphen in name, pass :relaxed-name to meta-ok\n";
=end code

=head1 Writing tests

As with any Perl project, the tests live under the C<t> directory in the
project's base directory.

A typical test file looks something like this:

=begin code :skip-test
use v6.c;
use Test;      # a Standard module included with Rakudo
use lib 'lib';

plan $num-tests;

# .... tests

done-testing;  # optional with 'plan'
=end code

We ensure that we're using Perl 6, via the C<use v6.c> pragma, then we load
the C<Test> module and specify where our libraries are.  We then specify how
many tests we I<plan> to run (such that the testing framework can tell us if
more or fewer tests were run than we expected) and when finished with the
tests, we use I<done-testing> to tell the framework we are done.

=head2 Thread safety

Note that routines in C<Test> module are I<not> thread-safe. This means you
should not attempt to use the testing routines in multiple threads
simultaneously, as the L<TAP|https://testanything.org/> output might come out of
order and confuse the program interpreting it.

There are no current plans to make it thread safe. If threaded-testing is
crucial to you, you may find some suitable
L<ecosystem modules|https://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=Test> to use
instead of C<Test> for your testing needs.

=head1 Running tests

Tests can be run individually by specifying the test filename on the
command line:

=for code :lang<shell>
$ perl6 t/test-filename.t

Or via the L<prove|https://perldoc.perl.org/prove.html> command from Perl 5,
where using C<--exec> to specify the executable that runs the tests:

=for code :lang<shell>
$ prove --exec perl6 -r t

To abort the test suite upon first failure, set the
C<PERL6_TEST_DIE_ON_FAIL> environmental variable:

=for code :lang<shell>
$ PERL6_TEST_DIE_ON_FAIL=1 perl6 t/test-filename.t

The same variable can be used within the test file. Set it before loading
the C<Test> module:

    BEGIN %*ENV<PERL6_TEST_DIE_ON_FAIL> = 1;
    use Test;
    ...

=head1 Test plans

Tests plans use L<C<plan>|/type/Test#plan> for declaring how many plans are
going to be done or, as might be the case, skipped. If no plan is declared,
L<C<done-testing>|/type/Test#done-testing> is used to declare the end of the
tests.

=head1 Testing return values

The C<Test> module exports various functions that check the return value of a
given expression and produce standardized test output.

In practice, the expression will often be a call to a function or method that
you want to unit-test. L<C<ok>|/type/Test#ok> and L<C<nok>|/type/Test#nok> will
match C<True> and C<False>. However, where possible it's better to use one of
the specialized comparison test functions below, because they can print more
helpful diagnostics output in case the comparison fails.

=head2 By string comparison

L<C<is>|/type/Test#is> and L<C<nok>|/type/Test#isnt> test for equality using the
proper operator, depending on the object (or class) it's handled.

=head2 By approximate numeric comparison

L<C<is-approx>|/type/Test#is-approx> compares numbers with a certain precision,
which can be absolute or relative. It can be useful for numeric values whose
precision will depend on the internal representation.

=head2 By structural comparison

Structures can be also compared using L<C<is-deeply>|/type/Test#is-deeply>,
which will check that internal structures of the objects compared is the same.

=head2 By arbitrary comparison

You can use any kind of comparison with L<C<cmp-ok>|/type/Test#cmp-ok>, which
takes as an argument the function or operator that you want to be used for
comparing.

=head2 By object type

L<C<isa-ok>|/type/Test#isa-ok> tests whether an object is of a certain type.


=head2 By method name

L<C<can-ok>|/type/Test#can-ok> is used on objects to check whether they have
that particular method.

=head2 By role

=item X<does-ok($variable, $role, $description?)|does-ok>

L<C<does-ok>|/type/Test#does-ok> checks whether the given variable can do a
certain L<Role|/language/objects#Roles>.

=head2 By regex

L<C<like>|/type/Test#like> and L<C<unlike>|/type/Test#unlike> check using
regular expressions; in the first case passes if a match exists, in the second
case when it does not.

=head1 Testing modules

Modules are tentatively loaded with L<C<use-ok>|/type/Test#use-ok>, which fails
if they fail to load.

=head1 Testing exceptions

L<C<dies-ok>|/type/Test#dies-ok> and L<C<lives-ok>|/type/Test#lives-ok> are
opposites ways of testing code; the first checks that it throws an exception,
the second that it does not; L<C<throws-like>|/type/Test#throws-like> checks
that the code throws the specific exception it gets handed as an argument;
L<C<fails-like>|/type/Test#fails-like>, similarly, checks if the code returns a
specific type of L<Failure|/type/Failure>. L<C<eval-dies-ok>|/type/Test#eval-dies-ok> and
L<C<eval-lives-ok>|/type/Test#eval-lives-ok> work similarly on strings that are
evaluated prior to testing.

=head1 Grouping tests

The result of a group of subtests is only C<ok> if all subtests are C<ok>; they
are grouped using L<C<subtest>|/type/Test#subtest>.


=head1 Skipping tests

Sometimes tests just aren't ready to be run, for instance a feature might not
yet be implemented, in which case tests can be marked as
L<C<todo>|/type/Test#todo>. Or it could be the case that a given feature only
works on a particular platform - in which case one would
L<C<skip>|/type/Test#skip> the test on other platforms;
L<C<skip-rest>|/type/Test#skip-rest> will skip the remaining tests instead of a
particular number given as argument; L<C<bail-out>|/type/Test#bail-out> will
simply exit the tests with a message.

=head1 Manual control

If the convenience functionality documented above does not suit your needs, you
can use the following functions to manually direct the test harness output;
L<C<pass>|/type/Test#pass> will say a test has passed, and
L<C<diag>|/type/Test#diag> will print a (possibly) informative message.

=TITLE Pod 6 Tables

=SUBTITLE The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

The official specification for PerlÂ 6 POD tables is located in the
Documentation specification here:
L<Tables|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/specs/master/S26-documentation.pod>.
Although Pod 6 specifications are not completely handled properly yet,
several projects are ongoing to correct the situation; one such
project is ensuring the proper handling of Pod 6 tables.

As part of that effort, this document explains the current state of
Pod 6 tables by example: valid tables, invalid tables, and ugly tables
(i.e., valid tables that, because of sloppy construction, may result
in something different than the user expects).

=head1 Restrictions

1. The only valid column separators are either visible (V<' | '> or V<' + '>)
(note at least one space is required before and after the visible column
separators) or invisible [two or more contiguous whitespace (WS)
characters (e.g., V<'  '>)].

2. Mixing visible and invisible column separators in the same table is
illegal.

3. The only valid row separator characters are V<'_'>, V<'-'>, V<'+'>, V<' '>,
V<'|'>, and V<'='>.

4. Consecutive row separator lines are illegal.

=head1 Best Practices

1. Use of WS for column separators is fragile, and they should only be
used for simple tables.  The C<Ugly Tables> section below illustrates
the problem.

2. Align table columns and rows carefully.  See the examples in later
best practices.

3. For tables with a heading and single- or multi-line content, use
one or more contiguous equal signs (V<'='>) as the row separator after
the heading, and use one or more contiguous hyphens (V<'-'>) as the row
separator in the content portion of the table.  For example,

=item Heading and single- or multi-line content

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
 hdr col 0 | hdr col 1
 ======================
 row 0     | row 0
 col 0     | col 1
 ----------------------
 row 1     | row 1
 col 0     | col 1
 ----------------------
=end table
=end code

=item Heading and single-line content

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
 hdr col 0   | hdr col 1
 ======================
 row 0 col 0 | row 0 col 1
 row 1 col 0 | row 1 col 1
=end table
=end code

4. For tables with no header and multi-line content, use one or more
contiguous hyphens (V<'-'>) as the row separator in the content portion
of the table.  For example,

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
 row 0       | row 0
 col 0       | col 1
 ----------------------
 row 1 col 0 | row 1 col 1
=end table
=end code

5. For tables with many rows and no multi-line content, using no row
separators is fine.  However, with one or more rows with multi-line
content, it is easier to ensure proper results by using a row
separator line (visible or invisible) between every content row.

=head1 Good Tables

Following are examples of valid (Good) tables (taken from the current
L<Specification Tests|https://github.com/perl6/roast>).

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
        The Shoveller   Eddie Stevens     King Arthur's singing shovel
        Blue Raja       Geoffrey Smith    Master of cutlery
        Mr Furious      Roy Orson         Ticking time bomb of fury
        The Bowler      Carol Pinnsler    Haunted bowling ball
=end table
=end code

=begin code :skip-test
=table
    Constants           1
    Variables           10
    Subroutines         33
    Everything else     57

=end code

=begin code :skip-test
=for table
    mouse    | mice
    horse    | horses
    elephant | elephants

=end code

=begin code :skip-test
=table
    Animal | Legs |    Eats
    =======================
    Zebra  +   4  + Cookies
    Human  +   2  +   Pizza
    Shark  +   0  +    Fish

=end code

=begin code :skip-test
=table
        Superhero     | Secret          |
                      | Identity        | Superpower
        ==============|=================|================================
        The Shoveller | Eddie Stevens   | King Arthur's singing shovel

=end code

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table

                        Secret
        Superhero       Identity          Superpower
        =============   ===============   ===================
        The Shoveller   Eddie Stevens     King Arthur's
                                          singing shovel

        Blue Raja       Geoffrey Smith    Master of cutlery

        Mr Furious      Roy Orson         Ticking time bomb
                                          of fury

        The Bowler      Carol Pinnsler    Haunted bowling ball

=end table
=end code

=begin code :skip-test
=table
    X | O |
   ---+---+---
      | X | O
   ---+---+---
      |   | X

=end code

=begin code :skip-test
=table
    X   O
   ===========
        X   O
   ===========
            X

=end code

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table

foo
bar

=end table
=end code

=head1 Bad Tables

Following are examples of invalid (Bad) tables, and they should
trigger an unhandled exception during parsing.  They are taken from
tests used in the table-pod-fix project mentioned above.  After
acceptance of the project's code into the Rakudo source, they will be
added to the current C<Specification Tests>.  Note they may not trigger
an exception at the moment, but they will after the project's code is
integrated.

=item Mixed column separator types in the same row are not allowed:

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
r0c0 +  r0c1 | r0c3
=end table
=end code

=item  Mixed visual and whitespace column separator type in the same table are not allowed:

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
r0c0 +  r0c1 | r0c3
r1c0    r0c1   r0c3
=end table
=end code

=item Two consecutive row separators are not allowed:

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
r0c0 |  r0c1
============
============
r1c0 |  r1c1
=end table
=end code

=head1 Ugly Tables

Following are examples of valid tables that are probably intended to
be two columns, but the columns are not aligned well so each
will parse as a single-column table.

=item  Unaligned columns with WS column separators:

Notice the second row has the two words separated by only B<one> WS
character, while it takes at least B<two> adjacent WS characters to define
a column separation.  B<This is a valid table but will be parsed as a
single-column table>.

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
r0c0    r0c1
 r1c0 r0c1
=end table
=end code

=item  Unaligned columns with visual column separators:

Notice the second row has the two words separated by a visible
character (V<'|'>) but the character is not recognized as a column
separator because it doesn't have an adjacent WS character on both
sides of it.  Although this is a legal table, the result will not
be what the user intended because the first row has two
columns while the second row has only one column, and it will thus have
an empty second column.

=begin code :skip-test
=begin table
r0c0  |  r0c1
 r1c0 |r0c1
=end table
=end code

=end pod

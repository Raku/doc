=TITLE Pod 6 tables

=SUBTITLE The good, the bad and the ugly

The official specification for Perl 6 POD tables is located in the
Documentation specification here:
L<Tables|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/specs/master/S26-documentation.pod>.
Although Pod 6 specifications are not completely handled properly yet,
several projects are ongoing to correct the situation; one such
project is ensuring the proper handling of Pod 6 tables.

As part of that effort, this document explains the current state of
Pod 6 tables by example: valid tables, invalid tables, and ugly tables
(i.e., valid tables that, because of sloppy construction, may result
in something different than the user expects).

=head1 Restrictions

1. The only valid column separators are either visible (V<' | '> or V<' + '>)
(note at least one space is required before and after the visible column
separators) or invisible [two or more contiguous whitespace (WS)
characters (e.g., V<'  '>)]. Column separators are not normally recognized
as such at the left or right side of a table, but one on the right side may
result in one or more empty cells depending upon the number of the cells in
other rows. (Note that a pipe or plus character meant as part of cell
data will result in an unintended extra column unless the character is escaped
with a backslash, e.g., '\|' or '\+'.)

2. Mixing visible and invisible column separators in the same table is
illegal.

3. The only valid row separator characters are V<'_'>, V<'-'>, V<'+'>, V<' '>,
V<'|'>, and V<'='>.

4. Consecutive interior row-separator lines are illegal.

5. Leading and trailing row-separator lines generate a warning.

6. Formatting blocks in table cells currently are ignored and treated as plain text.

HINT: During development, use of the environment variable C<RAKUDO_POD6_TABLE_DEBUG>
will show you how Rakudo interprets your pod tables before they are passed
to renderers such as B<Pod::To::HTML>, B<Pod::To::Text>, and B<Pod::To::Markdown>.

=head1 Best practices

HINT: Not adhering to the following best practices may require more table
processing due to additional looping over table rows.

1. Use of WS for column separators is fragile, and they should only be
used for simple tables.  The C<Ugly Tables> section below illustrates
the problem.

2. Align table columns and rows carefully.  See the examples in later
best practices.

3. Don't use visual borders on the table.

4. For tables with a heading and single- or multi-line content, use
one or more contiguous equal signs (V<'='>) as the row separator after
the heading, and use one or more contiguous hyphens (V<'-'>) as the row
separator in the content portion of the table.  For example,

=item Heading and single- or multi-line content

=begin code
=begin table
 hdr col 0 | hdr col 1
 ======================
 row 0     | row 0
 col 0     | col 1
 ----------------------
 row 1     | row 1
 col 0     | col 1
 ----------------------
=end table
=end code

=item Heading and single-line content

=begin code
=begin table
 hdr col 0   | hdr col 1
 ======================
 row 0 col 0 | row 0 col 1
 row 1 col 0 | row 1 col 1
=end table
=end code

5. For tables with no header and multi-line content, use one or more
contiguous hyphens (V<'-'>) as the row separator in the content portion
of the table.  For example,

=begin code
=begin table
 row 0       | row 0
 col 0       | col 1
 ----------------------
 row 1 col 0 | row 1 col 1
=end table
=end code

6. For tables with many rows and no multi-line content, using no row
separators is fine.  However, with one or more rows with multi-line
content, it is easier to ensure proper results by using a row
separator line (visible or invisible) between every content row.

7. Ensure intentionally empty cells have column separators, otherwise
expect a warning about short rows being filled with empty cells.
(Tables rows will always have the same number of cells as the
row with the most cells. Short rows are padded on the right with
empty cells and generate a warning.)

8. Adding a caption to a table is possible using the C<=begin table>
line as in this example:

=begin code
=begin table :caption<My Tasks>
mow lawn
take out trash
=end table
=end code

Although not a good practice, currently there is in use an alternate
method of defining a caption as shown in this example:

=begin code
=begin table :config{caption => "My Tasks"}
mow lawn
take out trash
=end table
=end code

Note the alternative method of putting the caption in the C<config> hash
was necessary before the C<:caption> method was implemented, but that
method is now considered to be deprecated. The practice will generate a
warning in the upcoming version C<6.d>, and it will raise an exception in
version C<6.e>.

=head1 Good tables

Following are examples of valid (Good) tables (taken from the current
L<Specification Tests|https://github.com/perl6/roast>).

=begin code
=begin table

        The Bowler      Carol Pinnsler    Haunted bowling ball

=end table
=end code

=begin code
=table
    X | O |
   ---+---+---
      | X | O
   ---+---+---
      |   | X

=end code

=begin code
=table
    X   O
   ===========
        X   O
   ===========
            X

=end code

=begin code
=begin table

foo
bar

=end table
=end code

=head1 Bad tables

Following are examples of invalid (Bad) tables, and they should
trigger an unhandled exception during parsing.

=item Mixed column separator types in the same row are not allowed:

=begin code
=begin table
r0c0 +  r0c1 | r0c3
=end table
=end code

=item  Mixed visual and whitespace column separator types in the same table are not allowed:

=begin code :skip-test<pod error>
=begin table
r0c0 +  r0c1 | r0c3
r1c0    r0c1   r0c3
=end table
=end code

=item Two consecutive interior row separators are not allowed:

=begin code :skip-test<pod error>
=begin table
r0c0 |  r0c1
============
============
r1c0 |  r1c1
=end table
=end code

=head1 Ugly tables

Following are examples of valid tables that are probably intended to
be two columns, but the columns are not aligned well so each
will parse as a single-column table.

=item  Unaligned columns with WS column separators:

Notice the second row has the two words separated by only B<one> WS
character, while it takes at least B<two> adjacent WS characters to define
a column separation.  B<This is a valid table but will be parsed as a
single-column table>.

=begin code
=begin table
r0c0    r0c1
 r1c0 r0c1
=end table
=end code

=item  Unaligned columns with visual column separators:

Notice the second row has the two words separated by a visible
character (V<'|'>) but the character is not recognized as a column
separator because it doesn't have an adjacent WS character on both
sides of it.  Although this is a legal table, the result will not
be what the user intended because the first row has two
columns while the second row has only one column, and it will thus have
an empty second column.

=begin code
=begin table
r0c0  |  r0c1
 r1c0 |r0c1
=end table
=end code

=end pod

=TITLE Unicode versus Texas symbols

=SUBTITLE Unicode symbols and their Texas (ASCII) counterparts

The following unicode symbols can be used in Perl 6 without needing to load
any additional modules.  Please note that the Since column applies to the
version of Perl the symbol was known to be available.  It is only mentioned
if it is different from C<6.c>.

=head1 Alphabetic Characters

Any codepoint that has the C<Ll>, C<Lu>, or C<Lt> property
can be used just like any other alphabetic character from the ASCII range,
like "A" or "a".  Any codepoint with the C<Lo> property can be used as
an alphabetic where case distinctions do not matter.

=head1 Numeric characters

Any codepoint that has the C<Nd> property, can be used as a digit in any
number, unless special cased in the list below.

=head1 Whitespace characters

Besides spaces and tabs you can use any other unicode whitespace character
that has the C<Zs>, C<Zl> or C<Zp> property.

=head1 Numeric values

Any codepoint that has the C<No> property can be used standalone as a numeric value,
such as ½ and ⅓.  (These aren't decimal digit characters, so can't be combined.)

=head1 Other acceptable codepoints

This list contains the codepoints (and their Texas (ASCII) equivalents) that
have a special meaning in Perl 6.

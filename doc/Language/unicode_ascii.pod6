=TITLE Unicode versus ASCII symbols

=SUBTITLE Unicode symbols and their ASCII equivalents

The following Unicode symbols can be used in Perl 6 without needing to
load any additional modules. Some of them have equivalents
which can be typed with ASCII-only characters. These variants are often
composed of more characters than the Unicode versions and so they look
bigger.

Reference is made below to various properties of unicode codepoints.
The definitive list can be found here:
L<https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt>.

=head1 Alphabetic characters

Any codepoint that has the C<Ll> (Letter, lowercase), C<Lu> (Letter,
uppercase), C<Lt> (Letter, titlecase), C<Lm> (Letter, modifier), or
the C<Lo> (Letter, other) property can be used just like any other
alphabetic character from the ASCII range.

=head1 Numeric characters

Any codepoint that has the C<Nd> (Number, decimal digit) property, can
be used as a digit in any number.  For example:

  my $var = １９; # U+FF11 U+FF19
  say $var + 2;  # OUTPUT: «21␤»

=head1 Numeric values

Any codepoint that has the C<No> (Number, other) or C<Nl> (Number, letter)
property can be used standalone as a numeric value, such as ½ and ⅓. (These
aren't decimal digit characters, so can't be combined.) For example:

  my $var = ⅒ + 2 + Ⅻ; # here ⅒ is No and Rat and Ⅻ is Nl and Int
  say $var;            # OUTPUT: «14.1␤»

=head1 Whitespace characters

Besides spaces and tabs you can use any other unicode whitespace
character that has the C<Zs> (Separator, space), C<Zl> (Separator,
line), or C<Zp> (Separator, paragraph) property.

=head1 Other acceptable single codepoints

This list contains the single codepoints [and their ASCII
equivalents] that have a special meaning in Perl 6.

=head2 Atomic operators

The atomic operators have C<U+269B ⚛ ATOM SYMBOL> incorporated into them. Their
ASCII equivalents are ordinary subroutines, not operators:

    my atomicint $x = 42;
    $x⚛++;                # Unicode version
    atomic-fetch-inc($x); # ASCII version

The ASCII alternatives are as follows:

X<|⚛=>X<|⚛>X<|⚛+=>X<|⚛-=>X<|⚛−=>X<|++⚛>X<|⚛++>X<|--⚛>X<|⚛-->

  ===============================================================
  ⚛=  | atomic-assign    |
  ⚛   | atomic-fetch     | this is the prefix:<⚛> operator
  ⚛+= | atomic-add-fetch |
  ⚛-= | atomic-sub-fetch |
  ⚛−= | atomic-sub-fetch | this operator uses U+2212 minus sign
  ++⚛ | atomic-inc-fetch |

=head1 Multiple codepoints

This list contains multiple-codepoint operators that require special
composition for their ASCII equivalents.  Note the codepoints
are shown space-separated but should be entered as adjacent codepoints
when used.

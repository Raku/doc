=TITLE Control Flow

=SUBTITLE Statements used to control the flow of execution

=head2 blocks

Like many languages, Perl6 uses C<blocks> delimited by C<{> and C<}>
to compartmentalize code.  When a block stands alone as a statement,
it will be entered immediately after the statement before it finishes,
and the statements inside it will be executed.  Otherwise, a block
simply creates a closure, which may be executed at a later time:

    say "We get here"; { say "then here." }; { say "not here"; 0; } or die;

In the above example, after running the first statement, the first
block stands alone as a second statement, so we run the statement inside
it.  The second block does not stand alone as a statement, so it instantiates
an object of type C<Block>, but does not run it.  Since any object instance
is true, the code does not die, even though that block would evaluate to 0,
were it to be executed.

Most of the flow control constructs covered below are just ways to
tell perl6 when, how, and how many times, to enter blocks like that
second block.

Before we go into those, an important side-note on syntax: If there is
nothing (or nothing but comments) on a line after a closing curly brace where
you would normally put semicolon, then you do not need the semicolon:

    # All three of these lines can appear as a group, as is, in a program
    { 42.say }                #-> says "42"
    { 43.say }                #-> says "43"
    { 42.say }; { 43.say }    #-> says "42" then says "43"

...but:

    { 42.say }  { 43.say }    #-> Syntax error
    { 42.say; } { 43.say }    #-> Also a syntax error, of course

So, be careful when you backspace in a line-wrapping editor:

    { "Without semicolons line-wrapping can be a bit treacherous.".say } \
    { 43.say } #-> Syntax error

You have to watch out for this in most languages anyway to prevent things
from getting accidentally commented out.  Many of the examples below may
have unnecessary semicolons for clarity.

=head2 do

The simplest way to run a block where it cannot be a stand-alone statement
is by writing C<do> before it:

    # This dies half of the time
    do { say "Heads I win, tails I die."; Bool.pick } or die; say "I win.";

Note that you need a space between the do and the block.

The whole C<do {...}> evaluates to the final value of the block.  The block
will be run when that value is needed in order to evaluate the rest of the
expression.  So:

    False and do { 42.say };

...will not say 42.  However, the block is only evaluated once each time
the expression it is contained in is evaluated:

    # This says "..1 ..2 ..3" not "..1 ...2 ....3"
    my $f = "."; say do { $f ~= "." } X~ 1,2,3;

In other words, it follows the same reification rules as everything else.

Technically, C<do> is a loop which runs exactly one iteration.

A C<do> may also be used on a bare statement (without brackets)
but this is mainly just useful for avoiding the syntactical need to
parenthesize a statement if it is the last thing in an expression:

    3, do if 1 { 2 }  ; #-> 3, 2
    3,   (if 1 { 2 }) ; #-> 3, 2
    3,    if 1 { 2 }  ; # Syntax error

...which brings us to C<if>.

=head2 if

To conditionally run a block of code, use a C<if> followed by a condition.
The condition, an expression, will be evaluated immediately after the
statement before the C<if> finishes.  The block attached to the condition will
only be evaluated if the condition means True when coerced to C<Bool>.
Unlike some languages the condition does not have to be parenthesized,
instead the C<{> and C<}> around the block are mandatory:

    if 1 { "1 is true".say }  ; # says "1 is true"
    if 1   "1 is true".say    ; # syntax error, missing block
    if 0 { "0 is true".say }  ; # does not say anything, because 0 is false
    if 42.say and 0 { 43.say }; # says "42" but does not say "43"

There is also a form of C<if> called a "statement modifier" form.  In this
case, the if and then the condition come after the code you want to run
conditionally.  Do note that the condition is still always evaluated first:

    43.say if 42.say and 0;     # says "42" but does not say "43"
    43.say if 42.say and 1;     # says "42" and then says "43"
    say "It is easier to read code when 'if's are kept on left of screen"
        if True;                # says the above, because it is true
    { 43.say } if True;         # says "43" as well

The statement modifier form is probably best used sparingly.

The C<if> statement itself will either return an empty list, if it does not
run the block, or it will return the value which the block produces:

    my $c = 0; say (1, (if 1 { $c += 42; 2; }), 3, $c); # says "1 2 3 42"
    my $d = 0; say (1, (if 0 { $d += 42; 2; }), 3, $d); # says "1 3 0"

Implementation note: Currently, Rakudo will say "1 Nil 3 0" for the last
example because it is not caught up to this part of the design yet.

For the statement modifier it is the same, except you have the value
of the statement instead of a block:

    say (1, (42 if True) , 2); # says "1 42 2"
    say (1, (42 if False), 2); # says "1 2"
    say (1,  42 if False , 2); # says "1 42" because "if False, 2" is true

Implementation note: Currently, Rakudo will say "1 Nil 2" for the second
example because it is not caught up to this part of the design yet.

The C<if> does not change the topic (C<$_>) by default.  In order to access
the value which the conditional expression produced, you have to ask
for it more strongly:

    $_ = 1; if 42 { $_.say }                ; # says "1"
    $_ = 1; if 42 -> $_ { $_.say }          ; # says "42"
    $_ = 1; if 42 -> $a { $_.say;  $a.say } ; # says "1" then says "42"
    $_ = 1; if 42       { $_.say; $^a.say } ; # says "1" then says "42"

=head3 else/elsif

A compound conditional may be produced by following an C<if> conditional
with C<else> to provide an alternative block to run when the conditional
expression is false:

    if 0 { say "no" } else { say "yes" }   ; # says "yes"
    if 0 { say "no" } else{ say "yes" }    ; # syntax error, space is required

The C<else> cannot be separated from the conditional statement by a
semicolon, but as a special case, it is OK to have a newline.

    if 0 { say "no" }; else { say "yes" }  ; # syntax error
    if 0 { say "no" }
    else { say "yes" }                     ; # says "yes"

Additional conditions may be sandwiched between the C<if> and the
C<else> using C<elsif>.  An extra condition will only be evaluated
if all the conditions before it were false, and only the block next to
the first true condition will be run.  You can end with an C<elsif>
instead of an C<else> if you want.

    if 0 { say "no" } elsif False { say "NO" } else { say "yes" } # says "yes"
    if 0 { say "no" } elsif True { say "YES" } else { say "yes" } # says "YES"

    if 0 { say "no" } elsif False { say "NO" } # does not say anything

    sub right { "Right!".say; True }
    sub wrong { "Wrong!".say; False }
    if wrong() { say "no" } elsif right() { say "yes" } else { say "maybe" }
    # The above says "Wrong!" then says "Right!" then says "yes"

You cannot use the statement modifier form with C<else> or C<elsif>:

    42.say if 0 else { 43.say }            # syntax error

All the same rules for semicolons and newlines apply, consistently

    if 0 { say 0 }; elsif 1 { say 1 }  else { say "how?" } ; # syntax error
    if 0 { say 0 }  elsif 1 { say 1 }; else { say "how?" } ; # syntax error
    if 0 { say 0 }  elsif 1 { say 1 }  else { say "how?" } ; # says "1"

    if 0 { say 0 } elsif 1 { say 1 }
    else { say "how?" }                                    ; # says "1"

    if 0 { say 0 }
    elsif 1 { say 1 } else { say "how?" }                  ; # says "1"

    if        0 { say "no" }
    elsif False { say "NO" }
    else        { say "yes" }                              ; # -> says "yes"

The whole tamale produces either an empty list (if no blocks were run)
or the value produced by the block which did run:

    my $c = 0; say (1,
                    (if 0 { $c += 42; "two"; } else { $c += 43; 2; }),
                    3, $c); # says "1 2 3 43"
    my $d = 0; say (1,
                    (if 0 { $d += 42; "two"; } elsif False { $d += 43; 2; }),
                    3, $d); # says "1 3 0"

Implementation note: Currently, Rakudo will say "1 Nil 3 0" for the last
example because it is not caught up to this part of the design yet.

Each block must individually say whether it wants to know what the
conditional expression evaluated to.  In the case of an C<else> that
has one or more C<elsif>s in front of it, the last C<elsif> determines
what the C<else> sees, since it was the last one tried:

    $_ = 1; if 0     { } else -> $a { "$_ $a".say } ; # says "1 0"
    $_ = 1; if False { } else -> $a { "$_ $a".say } ; # says "1 False"

    if False { } elsif 0 { } else -> $a { $a.say }  ; # says "0"

=head3 unless

When you get sick of typing "if not (X)" you may use C<unless> to invert
the sense of a conditional statement.  You cannot use C<else> or C<elsif>
with C<unless> because that ends up getting confusing.  Other than those
two differences C<unless> works the same as L<if>:

    unless 1 { "1 is false".say }  ; #-> does not say anything, since 1 is true
    unless 1   "1 is false".say    ; #-> syntax error, missing block
    unless 0 { "0 is false".say }  ; #-> says "0 is false"

    unless 42.say and 1 { 43.say } ; #-> says "42" but does not say "43"
    43.say unless 42.say and 0;      #-> says "42" and then says "43"
    43.say unless 42.say and 1;      #-> says "42" but does not say "43"

    $_ = 1; unless 0 { $_.say }           ; # -> says "1"
    $_ = 1; unless 0 -> $_ { $_.say }     ; # -> says "0"
    $_ = 1; unless False -> $a { $a.say } ; # -> says "False"

    my $c = 0; say (1, (unless 0 { $c += 42; 2; }), 3, $c); #-> says "1 2 3 42"
    my $c = 0; say (1, (unless 1 { $c += 42; 2; }), 3, $c); #-> says "1 3 0"

Implementation note: Currently, Rakudo will say "1 Nil 3 0" for the last
example because it is not caught up to this part of the design yet.

=head3 with, orwith, without

The C<with> statement is like C<if> but tests for definedness rather than
truth.  In addition, it topicalizes on the condition, much like C<given>:

    with "abc".index("a") { .say }      # prints 0

These may be cascaded:

    with   $s.index("a") { "Found a at $_" }
    orwith $s.index("b") { "Found b at $_" }
    orwith $s.index("c") { "Found c at $_" }
    else                 { "Didn't find a, b or c" }

You may intermix C<if>-based and C<with>-based clauses.

As with C<unless>, you may use C<without> to check for undefinedness,
but you may not add an C<else> clause:

    without $answer { fail "Got: $_" }

There are also C<with> and C<without> statement modifiers:

    return 42 with $answer;
    .throw without $answer;

=head2 for

The C<for> loop iterates over a list.

=begin code

for @foo {.print}

=end code

Use pointy block syntax to get an iteration variable.

=begin code

for @foo -> $item { print $item }

=end code

Multiple parameters can be declared.

=begin code

for %hash.kv -> $key, $value { print "$key => $value\n" }

=end code

The list in a C<for> loop is evaluated lazily by default, so to read a file
line by line, you could use

=begin code

for $*IN.lines -> $line {...}

=end code

Iteration variables are always lexical, so you don't need to use C<my> to give
them the appropriate scope. Also, they are read-only aliases. If you need them
to be read-write, use C«<->» instead of C«->». If you need to make C<$_>
read-write in a for loop, do so explicitly.

=begin code

for @cars <-> $_ {...}

=end code

=head2 gather/take

C<gather> is a statement or block prefix that returns a L<sequence|/type/Seq>
of values. The values come from calls to C<take> in the dynamic scope of the C<gather> block.

    my @a = gather {
        take 1;
        take 5;
        take 42;
    }
    say join ', ', @a;          # 1, 5, 42

C<gather/take> generates values lazily, so the C<gather> block generally runs only until it hits
the first C<take>. Code after the first C<take> is executed as soon as the next value is consumed
from the returned sequence.

For example

    my \vals = gather {
        take 1;
        say "Produced a value";
        take 2;
    }
    say vals[0];
    say 'between consumption of two values';
    say vals[1];

produces this output:

    1
    between consumption of two values
    Produced a value
    2


C<gather/take> is scoped dynamically, so you can call C<take> from subs or methods that are called
from within C<gather>:

    sub weird(@elems, :$direction = 'forward') {
        my %direction = (
            forward  => sub { take $_ for @elems },
            backward => sub { take $_ for @elems.reverse },
            random   => sub { take $_ for @elems.pick(*) },
        );
        return gather %direction{$direction}();
    }

    say weird(<a b c>, :direction<backward> );          # (c b a)


=head2 given

The C<given> statement is Perl 6's topicalizing keyword in a similar way that
C<switch> topicalizes in languages such as C.  In other words, C<given>
sets C<$_> inside the following block.  The keywords for individual cases
are C<when> and C<default>.  The usual idiom looks like this:

    given EXPR {
        when EXPR { ... }
        when EXPR { ... }
        default { ... }
    }

The C<given> statement is often used alone:

    given EXPR { .say; .Numeric; }

This is a lot more understandable than:

    { .say; .Numeric; }(EXPR)


=head3 default and when

A block containing a C<default> statement will be left immediately
when the sub-block after the C<default> statement is left.  It is
as though the rest of the statements in the block are skipped.

    given 42 {
        "This says".say;
        $_ == 42 and ( default { "This says, too".say; 43; } );
        "This never says".say;
    }
    # The above block evaluates to 43

A C<when> statement will also do this.

In addition, C<when> statements C<smartmatch> the topic (C<$_>) against
a supplied expression such that it is possible to check against values,
regular expressions, and types when specifying a match.

    for 42, 43, "foo", 44 {
        when Int { .say }
        default  { say "Not an Int" }
    }
    #-> 42 43 Not an Int 44

In this form, the C<given>/C<when> construct acts much like a set of
C<if>/C<elsif>/C<else> statements.  Be careful with the order of the
C<when> statements.  The following code says C<"Int"> not C<42>.

    given 42 {
        when Int { say "Int" }
        when 42  { say 42 }
        default  { say "huh?" }
    }
    #-> Int

=head3 proceed and succeed

Both C<proceed> and C<succeed> are meant to be used only from inside C<when>
or C<default> blocks.

The C<proceed> statement will immediately leave the C<when> or C<default>
block, skipping the rest of the statements, and resuming after the block.
This prevents the C<when> or C<default> from exiting the outer block.

    default {
        proceed;
        "This never says".say
    }
    "This says".say;

This is most often used to enter multiple C<when> blocks.  C<proceed> will
resume matching after a successful match, like so:

    given 42 {
        when Int   { say "Int"; proceed }
        when 42    { say 42 }
        when 40..* { say "greater than 40" }
        default    { say "huh?" }
    }
    # -> Int
    # -> 42

Note that the C<when 40..*> match didn't occur.  For this to match
such cases as well, one would need a proceed in the C<when 42> block.

This is not like a C<C> C<switch> statement, because the C<proceed> does
not merely enter the directly following block, it attempts to match
the C<given> value once more, consider this code:

    given 42 {
        when Int { "Int".say; proceed }
        when 43  { 43.say }
        when 42  { 42.say }
        default  { "got change for an existential answer?".say }
    }
    #-> Int
    #-> 42

...which matches the C<Int>, skips C<43> since the value doesn't match, matches
C<42> since this is the next positive match, but doesn't enter the
C<default> block since the C<when 42> block doesn't contain a C<proceed>.

By contrast, the C<succeed> keyword shortcircuits execution and exits the
entire C<given> block at that point.  It may also take an argument to
specify a final value for the block.

    given 42 {
        when Int {
            say "Int";
            succeed "Found";
            say "never this!";
        }
        when 42 { say 42 }
        default { say "dunno?" }
    }
    #-> Int

=head2 loop

The C<loop> statement is the C-style C<for> loop in disguise:

    loop (my $i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
        ...
    }

As in C, the parentheses are required if you supply the 3-part spec;
however, the 3-part loop spec may be entirely omitted to write an infinite
loop.  That is,

    loop {...}

is equivalent to the C-ish idiom:

    loop (;;) {...}

=head2 while, until

The C<while> statement executes the block as long as its condition is
true. So

=begin code

my $x = 1;
while $x < 4 {
print $x++;
}
print "\n";

=end code

produces

=begin code

123

=end code

Similarly, the C<until> statement executes the block as long as the
expression is false.

=begin code

my $x = 1;
until $x > 3 {
print $x++;
}
print "\n";

=end code

again produces

=begin code

123

=end code

The condition for C<while> or C<until> can be parenthesized, but there
must be a space between the keyword and the opening parenthesis of the
condition.

Both C<while> and C<until> can be used as statement modifiers. E. g.

=begin code

$x++ while $x < 12

=end code

Also see C<repeat/while> and C<repeat/until> below.

=head2 repeat/while, repeat/until

Perl 5 allows one to apply a statement modifier to a C<do> block such that
C-like constructs such as

    do {
        ...
    } while $x < 10;   # allowed in Perl 5; not in Perl 6

are possible.

This is specifically disallowed in Perl 6.  Nevertheless, one can repeat a
block up to a given condition in the same way wit a C<repeat> loop:

    repeat {
        ...
    } while $x < 10;

This can also be written quite naturally with C<until>:

    repeat {
        ...
    } until $x >= 10;

=head2 while

=comment TODO

=head2 return

=comment TODO

=head2 LABELs

C<while>, C<until>, and C<for> loops can all take a label, which can be
used to identify them for C<next>, C<last>, and C<redo>. For instance:

=begin code

LINE: for $*IN.lines -> $line {
    last LINE if $line ~~ /^$/;      # exit when done with header
    ...
}

=end code

=head2 next

The C<next> command starts the next iteration of the loop. So the code

=begin code

my @x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;
    for @x -> $x {
        next if $x == 3;
        print $x;
}

=end code

prints "1245".

=head2 last

The C<last> command immediately exits the loop in question.

=begin code

my @x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;
for @x -> $x {
    next if $x == 3;
    print $x;
}

=end code

prints "12".

=head2 redo

The C<redo> command restarts the loop block without evaluating the
conditional again.

=begin code

{ my $x = prompt("Enter a number"); redo unless is_a_number($x) }

=end code

=head2 goto

=comment TODO

=end pod

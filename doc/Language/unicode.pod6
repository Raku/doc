=TITLE Unicode

=SUBTITLE Unicode Support in Perl 6

Perl 6 has a high level of support of Unicode. This document aims to be both an
overview as well as describe Unicode features which don't belong in the documentation
for routines and methods.

For an overview on MoarVM's internal representation of strings, see the
L<MoarVM string documentation|https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/strings.asciidoc>.

=head1 File Handles and I/O

Perl6 applies X<normalization> by default to all input and output except for
file names which are stored as L<C<UTF8-C8>|#UTF8-C8>.
What does this mean? For example á can be represented 2 ways. Either using
one codepoint:

=for code :skip-test
    á (U+E1 "LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE")

Or two codepoints:

=for code :skip-test
    a +  ́ (U+61 "LATIN SMALL LETTER A" + U+301 "COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT")

Perl 6 will turn both these inputs into one codepoint, as is specified for
normalization form canonical (B<X<NFC>>). In most cases this is useful and means
that two inputs that are equivalent both are treated the same, and any text
you process or output from Perl 6 will be in this "canonical" form.

One case where we don't default to this, is for file handles. This is because
file handles must be accessed exactly as the bytes are written on the disk.

You can use L<UTF8-C8|#UTF8-C8> with any file handle to read the exact bytes as they are
on disk. They may look funny when printed out, if you print it out using a
UTF8 handle. If you print it out to a handle where the output is UTF8-C8,
then it will render as you would normally expect, and be a byte for byte exact
copy. More technical details on L<UTF8-C8|#UTF8-C8> on MoarVM below.

=head2 X<UTF8-C8>

X<UTF-8 Clean-8> is an encoder/decoder that primarily works as the UTF-8 one.
However, upon encountering a byte sequence that will either not decode as
valid UTF-8, or that would not round-trip due to normalization, it will use
NFG synthetics to keep track of the original bytes involved. This means that
encoding back to UTF-8 Clean-8 will be able to recreate the bytes as they
originally existed. The synthetics contain 4 codepoints:

=item The codepoint 0x10FFFD (which is a private use codepoint)
=item The codepoint 'x'
=item The upper 4 bits of the non-decodable byte as a hex char (0..9A..F)
=item The lower 4 bits as the non-decodable byte as a hex char (0..9A..F)

Under normal UTF-8 encoding, this means the unrepresentable characters will
come out as something like `?xFF`.

UTF-8 Clean-8 is used in places where MoarVM receives strings from the
environment, command line arguments, and file system queries.

=head1 Entering Unicode Codepoints and Codepoint Sequences

You can enter Unicode codepoints by number (decimal as well as hexadecimal).  For example, the character named
"latin capital letter ae with macron" has decimal codepoint 482 and hexadecimal codepoint 0x1E2:

    say "\c[482]"; # OUTPUT: «Ǣ␤»
    say "\x1E2";   # OUTPUT: «Ǣ␤»

You can also access Unicode codepoints by name:
Rakudo supports all Unicode 9.0 names. X<|\c[] unicode name>

    say "\c[PENGUIN]"; # OUTPUT: «🐧␤»
    say "\c[BELL]";    # OUTPUT: «🔔␤» (U+1F514 BELL)

All Unicode codepoint names/named seq/emoji sequences are now case-insensitive:
[Starting in 2017.02]

    say "\c[latin capital letter ae with macron]"; # OUTPUT: «Ǣ␤»
    say "\c[latin capital letter E]";              # OUTPUT: «E␤» (U+0045)

You can specify multiple characters by using a comma separated list with C<\c[]>. You
can combine numeric and named styles as well:

    say "\c[482,PENGUIN]"; # OUTPUT: «Ǣ🐧␤»

In addition to using C<\c[]> inside interpolated strings, you can also use
the L<parse-names routine|/type/Str#routine_parse-names>
or the parse-names method.

    say "DIGIT ONE".parse-names;  # OUTPUT: «1␤»
    say parse-names("DIGIT ONE"); # OUTPUT: «1␤»

=head2 Name Aliases

By name alias. Name Aliases are used mainly for codepoints without an official
name, for abbreviations, or for corrections (Unicode names never change).
For full list of them see L<here|http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/NameAliases.txt>.

Control codes without any official name:

    say "\c[ALERT]";     # Not visible (U+0007 control code (also accessible as \a))
    say "\c[LINE FEED]"; # Not visible (U+000A same as "\n")

Corrections:

    say "\c[LATIN CAPITAL LETTER GHA]"; # OUTPUT: «Ƣ␤»
    say "Ƣ".uniname; # OUTPUT: «LATIN CAPITAL LETTER OI␤»
    # This one is a spelling mistake that was corrected in a Name Alias:
    say "\c[PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET]".uniname;
    # OUTPUT: «PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRAKCET␤»

Abbreviations:

    say "\c[ZWJ]".uniname;  # OUTPUT: «ZERO WIDTH JOINER␤»
    say "\c[NBSP]".uniname; # OUTPUT: «NO-BREAK SPACE␤»

=head2 Named Sequences

You can also use any of the L<Named Sequences|http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/NamedSequences.txt>,
these are not single codepoints, but sequences of them. [Starting in 2017.02]

    say "\c[LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH VERTICAL LINE BELOW AND ACUTE]";      # OUTPUT: «É̩␤»
    say "\c[LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH VERTICAL LINE BELOW AND ACUTE]".ords; # OUTPUT: «(201 809)␤»

=head3 Emoji Sequences

Rakudo has support for Emoji 4.0 (the latest non-draft release) sequences.
For all of them see:
L<Emoji ZWJ Sequences|http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/4.0/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt>
and L<Emoji Sequences|http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/4.0/emoji-sequences.txt>.
Note that any names with commas should have their commas removed, since Perl 6 uses
commas to separate different codepoints/sequences inside the same C<\c> sequence.

    say "\c[woman gesturing OK]";         # OUTPUT: «🙆‍♀️␤»
    say "\c[family: man woman girl boy]"; # OUTPUT: «👨‍👩‍👧‍👦␤»

=SUBTITLE How to create, use, and distribute Raku modules

=head1 Creating and using modules

A module is usually a source file or set of source files that expose Raku
constructs N<Technically a module is a set of I<compunits> which are usually
files but could come from anywhere as long as there is a I<compunit repository>
that can provide it. See L<S11|https://github.com/Raku/old-design-docs/blob/master/S11-modules.pod>.>.

Modules are typically packages (L<classes|/language/objects#Classes>,
L<roles|/language/objects#Roles>, L<grammars|/type/Grammar>),
L<subroutines|/language/functions>, and sometimes
L<variables|/language/variables>. In Raku I<module> can also refer to a type of
package declared with the C<module> keyword (see L<Module
Packages|/language/module-packages> and the examples below) but here we mostly
mean "module" as a set of source files in a namespace.

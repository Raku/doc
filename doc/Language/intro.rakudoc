=TITLE Brief introduction

=SUBTITLE Using Raku official documentation

This official documentation covers a variety of presentation styles.
See the main L</introduction> and L</reference> pages for a list of documents in
the following styles.

=begin item
Raku has a high level of L<unicode support|/language/unicode>, including
many unicode operators. While this may be daunting for those coming from an
ASCII background, we have some L<help|/language/unicode#Entering_unicode_codepoints_and_codepoint_sequences> introducing
users to how to use it in your program. Finally, if you would really prefer
to use ASCII, you can in L<most cases|/language/unicode_ascii>.
=end item

=begin item
For programmers with experience in other languages, there are a number of
B<Migration Guides> that compare and contrast the features of Raku with other
languages, including Perl, JavaScript, and Haskell.
=end item

=begin item
L<C<Signatures>|/type/Signature> - Each routine, which includes subroutines and
methods, has a signature. Understanding the information given in the signature
of a C<sub> or C<method> provides a quick way to grasp the operation and effect
of the routine, and if provided in the signature, this may not be called out
explicitly in the text.
=end item

=begin item
L<C<Containers>|/language/containers> - Variables, which are like the nouns of
a computer language, are containers in which information is stored. The first
character in the name of a container, called a sigil, conveys information about
the container.  For example, the C<$> of C<$my-variable>, or
C<@> of C<@an-array-of-things>, or C<%> of C<%scores-by-name>,

I<Note you can store an
L<C<Array>|/type/Array> in a C<$> container and treat it as a single object.>
=end item

=begin item
L<C<Classes and Roles>|/language/classtut> - Raku is fundamentally based on
objects, which are described in terms of classes and roles. Raku, unlike some
languages, does not B<impose> object-oriented programming practices, and useful
programs can be written in a procedural style. However,
complex software, such as the Rakudo compiler of Raku, is made much simpler
by writing in object-oriented idioms, which is why the Raku documentation is
more easily understood by reviewing what a class is and what a role is.
=end item

=begin item
L<C<Traps to Avoid>|/language/traps> - Several common assumptions lead to code
that does not work as the programmer intended. This section identifies some
of them.
=end item

=begin item
There are a number of L<C<useful resources>|https://raku.org> listed
on the raku.org site. These include articles, books, slide
presentations, and videos.
=end item

=begin item
You will see examples throughout the document, like so:

=for code
my @a = 1, 2, 3;
@a»++;
say @a;             # OUTPUT: «[2 3 4]␤»

Note on the last line, there is a comment, starting with C<# OUTPUT:>, that shows what the example outputs.
The output is wrapped in C<«»> quotes (also a valid quoting construct in Raku!), and may include a C<␤>, which
is the Unicode character "Symbol for Newline" - to indicates where in the actual output a literal newline would
appear.

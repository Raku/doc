=TITLE Doing math with Perl 6

=SUBTITLE Different mathematical paradigms and how they are implemented in this language

=head1 Sets

Perl 6 includes the L<Set|/type/Set> data type, as well as support for
L<most set operations|/language/setbagmix#Set/Bag_operators>.
L<Union and intersection|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets>
are not only native operations, they use their I<natural> symbols, ∩ and ∪. For
instance, this code would check the fundamental laws of the arithmetic of sets
for a limited number of sets:

=begin code
my @arbitrary-numbers = ^100;
my \U = @arbitrary-numbers.Set;

my @sets;

@sets.push: Set.new( @arbitrary-numbers.pick( @arbitrary-numbers.elems.rand)) for @arbitrary-numbers;

my (@union, @intersection);

for @sets -> $set {
    @union.push: $set ∩ $set === $set;
    @intersection.push: $set ∪ $set === $set;
}

say "Idempotent union is ", so @union.all;
# OUTPUT: «Idempotent union is True»
say "Idempotent intersection is ", so @intersection.all;
# OUTPUT: «Idempotent intersection is True»
my (@universe, @empty-set, @id-universe, @id-empty);

for @sets -> \A {
    @universe.push: A ∪ U === U;
    @id-universe.push: A ∩ U === A;
    @empty-set.push: A ∩ ∅ === ∅;
    @id-empty.push: A ∪ ∅ === A;
}

say "Universe dominates ", so @universe.all;    # OUTPUT: «Universe dominates True»
say "Empty set dominates ", so @empty-set.all;  # OUTPUT: «Empty set dominates True»

say "Identity with U ", so @id-universe.all;    # OUTPUT: «Identity with U True»
say "Identity with ∅ ", so @id-empty.all;       # OUTPUT: «Identity with ∅ True»
=end code

In this code, which uses the L<empty set|/language/setbagmix#term_%E2%88%85>
which is already defined by Perl 6, not only do we check if the equalities in the
algebra of sets hold, we also use, via L<sigilless variables|/language/variables#index-entry-\_(sigilless_variables)> and the
Unicode form of the set operators, expressions that are as close as possible to
the original form; C<A ∪ U === U>, for example, except for the use of the
L<value identity operator <===>|/routine/===> is very close to the actual
mathematical expression in the L<Wikipedia entry|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets>.

We can even test De Morgan's law, as in the code below:

=begin code
my @alphabet = 'a'..'z';
my \U = @alphabet.Set;
sub postfix:<⁻>(Set $a) { U ⊖ $a }
my @sets;
@sets.push: Set.new( @alphabet.pick( @alphabet.elems.rand)) for @alphabet;
my ($de-Morgan1,$de-Morgan2) = (True,True);
for @sets X @sets -> (\A, \B){
    $de-Morgan1 &&= (A ∪ B)⁻  === A⁻ ∩ B⁻;
    $de-Morgan2 &&= (A ∩ B)⁻  === A⁻ ∪ B⁻;
}
say "1st De Morgan is ", $de-Morgan1;
say "2nd De Morgan is ", $de-Morgan2;
=end code

We declare C<⁻> as the I<complement> operation, which computes the symmetrical
difference ⊖ between the Universal set C<U> and our set. Once that is declared,
it is relatively easy to express operations such as the complementary of the
union of A and B, C<(A ∪ B)⁻>, with a notation that is very close to the original
mathematical notation.

=head1 Arithmetic

Perl 6 can do arithmetic using different data types. L<Num|/type/Num>, L<Rat|/type/Rat> and
L<Complex|/type/Complex> can all operate as a L<field under the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)>
(technically, it should be noted that data types dealing with floating point number representations are not a field in the mathematical sense due to the inherent
imprecisions of their arithmetic. However, they constitute an approximate enough, computer friendly version of such mathematical objects for most of the cases).
The equivalent mathematical fields are:

=begin table
Perl 6 class       Field
=============    ==============================================
Rat              ℚ
Num              ℝ
Complex          ℂ
=end table

The C<Int>s or ℤ, as they're usually called in mathematics, are not a
mathematical field but rather a ring, since they are not closed under
multiplicative inverses. However, if the integer division C<div> is used, their operations will always
yield other integers; if C</> is used, on the other hand, in general the result will be a
L<Rat|/type/Rat>.

Besides, C<Int> can do infinite-precision arithmetic (or at least infinite as
memory allows; C<Numeric overflow> can still occur), without falling back to
L<Num|/type/Num> if the number is too big:

    my @powers = 2, 2 ** * ... Inf; say @powers[4].chars; # OUTPUT: «19729␤»

Also strictly speaking, the Rational class that behaves like a mathematical
field is L<FatRat|/type/FatRat>. For efficiency reasons, operating with C<Rat>s will fall
back to C<Num> when the numbers are big enough or when there is a big
difference between numerator and denominator. C<FatRat> can work with arbitrary
precision, the same as the default C<Int> class.

Some modules in the ecosystem can work with additional data types
mathematically:

=item L<C<Math::Vector>|https://github.com/colomon/Math-Vector>
basic operations for L<vectors|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector>.

=item L<C<Math::Matrix>|https://github.com/pierre-vigier/Perl6-Math-Matrix>
operates on L<matrices rings over numeric rings|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)>.

=item L<C<Math::Quaternion>|https://github.com/Util/Perl6-Math-Quaternion>
operates on the L<quaternion algebra, ℍ|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion>,
which are a generalization of complex numbers.

=item L<C<Math::Polynomial>|https://github.com/colomon/Math-Polynomial> works
with polynomials, and is able to do simple arithmetic with them.

=item L<C<Math::Symbolic>|https://github.com/raydiak/Math-Symbolic>, for
symbolic math.

Numbers are duck-typed automatically to the numeric class they actually
represent:

    .^name.say for (4, ⅗, 1e-9, 3+.1i); # OUTPUT: «Int␤Rat␤Num␤Complex␤»

Which makes also arithmetic operations the most adequate for the particular type

    say .33-.22-.11 == 0; # OUTPUT: «True␤»

In this case, all numbers are interpreted as C<Rat>s, which makes the operation
exact. In general, most languages would interpret them as floating point
numbers,

    say .33.Num -.22.Num - .11.Num; # OUTPUT: «1.3877787807814457e-17␤»

For cases such as this, Perl 6 also includes an C<approximately equal> operator,
L<≅|/language/operators#infix_=~=>

    say .33.Num -.22.Num - .11.Num ≅ 0; # OUTPUT: «True␤»


=head1 Sequences

A L<sequence|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence> is an I<enumerated>
collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed, and also a first-class
data type in Perl 6 called L<Seq|/type/Seq>. C<Seq> is able to represent infinite
sequences, like the natural numbers:

    my \𝕟 = 1,2 … ∞;
    say 𝕟[3];         # OUTPUT: «4␤»

Infinite sequences use ∞, C<Inf> or C<*> (Whatever) as terminator. L<…|/language/operators#infix_...> is the
list generator, which in fact can understand arithmetic and geometric
progression sequences as long as you insert the first numbers:

    say 1,5,9 … * > 100;
    # OUTPUT: «(1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61 65 69 73 77 81 85 89 93 97 101)␤»
    say 1,3,9 … * > 337; # OUTPUT: «(1 3 9 27 81 243 729)␤»

The first sequence will be terminated when the generated number is bigger than
100; the second sequence, which is a geometric progression, when it is bigger
than 337.

The fact that an arbitrary generator can be used makes easy to generate
sequences such as L<Fibonacci's|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>:

    say 1,1, * + * … * > 50;#  OUTPUT: «(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55)␤»

We can, in fact, compute the approximation to the L<golden ratio|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio> this way:

    my @phis = (2.FatRat, 1 + 1 / * ... *);
    my @otherphi = (1 - @phis[200], 1 + 1 / * ... *);
    say @otherphi[^10, |(20, 30 ... 100)];  # OUTPUT:
    # «((-0.61803398874989484820458683436563811772030918
    # -0.61803398874989484820458683436563811772030918
    # -0.61803398874989484820458683436563811772030918
    # -0.61803398874989484820458683436563811772030918
    # -0.61803398874989484820458683436563811772030918
    # -0.618033…»

The L<Math::Sequences|https://github.com/ajs/perl6-Math-Sequences> module
includes many mathematical sequences, already defined for you. It defines many
L<sequences from the encyclopedia|https://oeis.org/>, some of them with their
original name, such as ℤ.

Some set operators also operate on sequences, and they can be used to find out if an object is part of it:

    say 876 ∈ (7,14 … * > 1000) ; # OUTPUT: «False␤»

In this particular case, we can find out if C<876> is a multiple of 7 straight
away, but the same principle holds for other sequences using complicated
generators. And we can use set inclusion operators too:

    say (55,89).Set ⊂ (1,1, * + * … * > 200); # OUTPUT: «True␤»

although it does not take into account if it is effectively a subsequence, just
the presence of the two elements here. Sets have no order, and even if you don't
explicitly cast the subsequence into a Set or explicitly cast it into a C<Seq>
it will be coerced into such for the application of the inclusion operator.


=head1 Mathematical constants

Perl 6 includes already a set of mathematical constants as part of the core.

    say π; # OUTPUT: «3.141592653589793»
    say τ; # Equivalent to 2π; OUTPUT: «6.283185307179586»
    say 𝑒; # OUTPUT: «2.718281828459045␤»

which are available also by their Latin name, C<e>, C<pi> and C<tau>, with the
same value (although 𝑒 is not available outside the MoarVM).

The L<Math::Constants|https://github.com/JJ/p6-math-constants/pulls> module
includes an additional series of physical and mathematical constants such as the
previously mentioned golden ratio φ or the Planck's constant ℎ.

Since Perl 6 allows for definition of variables that use Unicode graphemes, and
also variable and constant names without any kind of sigil, it is considered a
good practice to use the actual mathematical name of concepts to denominate them
wherever possible.

=head1 Numerical integration of ordinary differential equations

Perl 6 is an amazing programming language, and of course, you can do a
lot of cool math with it. A great amount of work during an applied
mathematician's work is to simulate the models they create. For this
reason, in every coding language, a numerical integrator is a must-have.
Learning about how to do this in Perl 6 can easily be a good way to have
a nice goal while learning a new coding language.

=head2 Requirements

In Perl 6 there are some modules in the ecosystem that can do the job we
want in a very easy way :
=item L<C<Math::Model>|https://github.com/moritz/Math-Model>
which lets you write mathematical and physical models in an easy and
natural way.
=item L<C<Math::RungeKutta>|https://github.com/moritz/Math-RungeKutta>
Runge-Kutta integration for systems of ordinary, linear differential
equations.

For this example we are going to use
L<C<Math::Model>|https://github.com/moritz/Math-Model> for its
useful syntax, but remember that this module requires
L<C<Math::RungeKutta>|https://github.com/moritz/Math-RungeKutta> as well.
Simply install them with I<zef> before using these examples.
In the future it should be a nice idea to add other modules.

=head2 Malthus model

Let's start with the I<'Hello World'> of mathematical Ecology:
L<Malthusian growth model|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_growth_model>.
A Malthusian growth model, sometimes called a simple exponential growth
model, is essentially exponential growth based on the idea of the
function being proportional to the speed to which the function grows.
The equation, then, looks like this:

I<dx/dt = g*x>

I<x(0) = x_0>

Where I<g> is the population growth rate, sometimes called Malthusian
parameter.

How can we translate that into Perl 6? Well Math::Model brings some help
with a very understandable way to do that--let's see it:

=begin code :skip-test<can't use>
use Math::Model;

my $m = Math::Model.new(
    derivatives => {
        velocity     => 'x',
    },
    variables   => {
        velocity           => { $:growth_constant * $:x},
        growth_constant    => { 1 },   # basal growth rate
    },
    initials    => {
        x       => 3,
    },
    captures    => ('x'),
);

$m.integrate(:from(0), :to(8), :min-resolution(0.5));
$m.render-svg('population growth malthus.svg', :title('population growth'));
=end code

To fully understand what is going on, let me explain it step by step.

=head3 Step by step explanation.

=begin item
First we load the module that make
the calculations: L<C<Math::Model>|https://github.com/moritz/Math-Model>.

=begin code :skip-test<Snippet for explanation purposes>
use Math::Model;
=end code
=end item

=begin item
We create the model to add all the information in it.
=begin code :skip-test<Snippet for explanation purposes>
my $m = Math::Model.new(
=end code
=end item

=begin item
We declare the derivatives that are in our model. In this case, if
you remember our equation, we have our variable I<x> and its derivative
I<x'> (usually know as the velocity).

=begin code
derivatives => {
    velocity     => 'x',
    },
=end code
=end item

=begin item
After that, we declare how our models evolve. We just need
formulas for the derivatives that are not also integration variables
(in this case, only I<x>), and for other variables we use in the formulas
 (the growth rate).

=begin code
variables   => {
    velocity           => { $:growth_constant * $:x},
    growth_constant    => { 1 },   # basal growth rate
},
=end code
=end item


=begin item
Finally we declare our initial conditions and use I<captures> to
tell L<C<Math::Model>|https://github.com/moritz/Math-Model> which
variable or variables to record while the simulation is running.

=begin code
initials    => {
    x       => 3,
},
captures    => ('x'),
=end code
=end item


At this point our model is set. We need to run the simulation and render
 a cool plot about our results:
=begin code :skip-test<Snippet for explanation purposes>
$m.integrate(:from(0), :to(8), :min-resolution(0.5));
$m.render-svg('population growth malthus.svg', :title('population growth'));
=end code

There, we select our time limits and the resolution. Next, we generate a
 plot.
All understood? Well, let's see our result!

L<link to the image|https://rawgit.com/thebooort/perl-6-math-model-tutorial/master/population%20growth%20malthus.svg>

Looks great! But to be honest, it is quit unrepresentative. Let's explore
 other examples from more complex situations!

=head2 Logistic model

Resources aren't infinite and our population is not going to grow
forever. P-F Verhulst thought the same thing, so he presented the
L<logistic model|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function>. This
 model is a common model of population growth, where the rate of
 reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the
  amount of available resources, all else being equal.
It looks like this:

I<dx/dt = g*x*(1-x/k)>
I<x(0)=x_0>

where the constant g defines the growth rate and k is the carrying
 capacity.
Modifying the above code we can simulate its behavior in time:

=begin code :skip-test<can't use>
use Math::Model;

my $m = Math::Model.new(
    derivatives => {
        velocity     => 'x',
    },
    variables   => {
        velocity           => { $:growth_constant * $:x - $:growth_constant * $:x * $:x / $:k },
        growth_constant    => { 1 },   # basal growth rate
        k                  => { 100 }, # carrying capacity
    },
    initials    => {
        x       => 3,
    },
    captures    => ('x'),
);

$m.integrate(:from(0), :to(8), :min-resolution(0.5));
$m.render-svg('population growth logistic.svg', :title('population growth'));
=end code

Let's look at our cool plot:
L<link to the image|https://rawgit.com/thebooort/perl-6-math-model-tutorial/master/population%20growth%20logistic.svg>

As you can see population growths till a maximum.

=head2 Strong Allee Effect

Interesting, isn't it? Even if these equations seem basic they are
linked to a lot of behaviors in our world, like tumor growth. But,
before end, let me show you a curious case.
Logistic model could be accurate but... What happens when, from a
certain threshold, the population size is so small that the survival
rate and / or the reproductive rate drops due to the individual's inability
 to find other ones?

Well, this is an interesting phenomenon described by W.C.Allee, usually
known as L<Allee effect|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allee_effect>.
A simple way to obtain different behaviors associated with this effect
is to use the logistic model as a departure, add some terms, and get a
cubic growth model like this one:

I<dx/dt=r*x*(x/a-1)*(1-x/k)>

where all the constants are the same as before and A is called
I<critical point>.

Our code would be:

=begin code :skip-test<can't use>
use Math::Model;

my $m = Math::Model.new(
    derivatives => {
        velocity_x    => 'x',
    },
    variables   => {
        velocity_x           => { $:growth_constant * $:x *($:x/$:a -1)*(1- $:x/$:k) },
        growth_constant    => { 0.7 },   # basal growth rate
        k                  => { 100 }, # carrying capacity
        a                  => { 15 },  # critical point
    },
    initials    => {
        x       => 15,
    },
    captures    => ('x'),
);

$m.integrate(:from(0), :to(100), :min-resolution(0.5));
$m.render-svg('population growth allee.svg', :title('population growth'));
=end code

Try to execute this one yourself to see the different behaviors that
arise when you change the initial condition around the critical point!

=head2 Weak Allee Effect

Whilst the strong Allee effect is a demographic Allee effect with a critical
population size or density, the weak Allee effect is a demographic Allee effect
without a critical population size or density, i.e., a population exhibiting a
weak Allee effect will possess a reduced per capita growth rate at lower population
density or size. However, even at this low population size or density, the population
will always exhibit a positive per capita growth rate. This model differs lightly from
the strong one, getting a new formula:

I<dx/dt=r*x*(1-x/k)*(x/a)**n>, with n>0

Our code would be:

=begin code :skip-test<can't use>
use Math::Model;

my $m = Math::Model.new(
    derivatives => {
        velocity_x    => 'x',
    },
    variables   => {
        velocity_x           => { $:growth_constant * $:x *(1- $:x/$:k)*($:x/$:a)**$:n },
        growth_constant    => { 0.7 },   # basal growth rate
        k                  => { 100 }, # carrying capacity
        a                  => { 15 },  # critical point
        n                  => { 4  }
    },
    initials    => {
        x       => 15,
    },
    captures    => ('x'),
);

$m.integrate(:from(0), :to(100), :min-resolution(0.5));
$m.render-svg('population growth allee.svg', :title('population growth'));
=end code

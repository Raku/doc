=TITLE Unicode versus Texas symbols

=SUBTITLE Unicode symbols and their Texas (ASCII) counterparts

The following unicode symbols can be used in Perl 6 without needing to
load any additional modules.  Please note that the Since column
applies to the version of Perl the symbol was known to be available.
It is only mentioned if it is different from C<6.c>.

Reference is made below to various properties of unicode codepoints.
The definitive list can be found here:
L<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt>.

=head1 Alphabetic Characters

Any codepoint that has the C<Ll> (Letter, lowercase), C<Lu> (Letter,
uppercase), C<Lt> (Letter, titlecase), C<Lm> (Letter, modifier), or
the C<Lo> (Letter, other) property can be used just like any other
alphabetic character from the ASCII range.

=head1 Numeric characters

Any codepoint that has the C<Nd> (Number, decimal digit) property, can
be used as a digit in any number.  For example:

  my $var = １９; # U+FF11 U+FF19
  say $var + 2;  # OUTPUT: «21␤»

=head1 Numeric values

Any codepoint that has the C<No> (Number, other) or C<Nl> (Number, letter)
property can be used standalone as a numeric value, such as ½ and ⅓. (These
aren't decimal digit characters, so can't be combined.) For example:

  my $var = ⅒ + 2 + Ⅻ; # here ⅒ is No and Rat and Ⅻ is Nl and Int
  say $var;            # OUTPUT: «14.1␤»

=head1 Whitespace characters

Besides spaces and tabs you can use any other unicode whitespace
character that has the C<Zs> (Separator, space), C<Zl> (Separator,
line), or C<Zp> (Separator, paragraph) property.

=head1 Other acceptable single codepoints

This list contains the single codepoints [and their Texas (ASCII)
equivalents] that have a special meaning in Perl 6.

=head1 Multiple codepoints

This list contains multiple-codepoint operators that require special
composition for their Texas (ASCII) equivalents.  Note the codepoints
are shown space-separated but should be entered as adjacent codepoints
when used.

=head1 The C<Iterator> and C<Iterable> roles

Raku is a functional language, but functions need something to hold on to when
working on complex data structures. In particular, they need a uniform interface
that can be applied to all data structures in the same way. One of these kind of
interfaces is provided by the L<Iterator|/type/Iterator> and
L<Iterable|/type/Iterable> roles.

The C<Iterable> role is relatively simple. It provides a stub for the
C<iterator> method, which is the one actually used by statements such as C<for>.
C<for> will call C<.iterator> on the variable it precedes, and then run a block
once for every item. Other methods, such as array assignment, will make the
C<Iterable> class behave in the same way.

=begin code
class DNA does Iterable {
    has $.chain;
    method new ($chain where {
                       $chain ~~ /^^ <[ACGT]>+ $$ / and
                       $chain.chars %% 3 } ) {
        self.bless( :$chain );
    }

    method iterator(DNA:D:){ $.chain.comb.rotor(3).iterator }
};

my @longer-chain =  DNA.new('ACGTACGTT');
say @longer-chain.raku;
# OUTPUT: «[("A", "C", "G"), ("T", "A", "C"), ("G", "T", "T")]␤»

say  @longer-chain».join("").join("|"); # OUTPUT: «ACG|TAC|GTT␤»
=end code

In this example, which is an extension of the L<example in C<Iterable> that
shows how C<for> calls C<.iterator>|/type/Iterable>, the C<iterator> method will
be called in the appropriate context only when the created object is assigned to
a L<Positional|/type/Positional> variable, C<@longer-chain>; this variable is an
L<Array|/type/Array> and we operate on it as such in the last example.

The (maybe a bit confusingly named) C<Iterator> role is a bit more complex than
C<Iterable>. First, it provides a constant, C<IterationEnd>. Then, it also
provides a series of L<methods|/type/Iterator#Methods> such as C<.pull-one>,
which allows for a finer operation of iteration in several contexts: adding or
eliminating items, or skipping over them to access other items. In fact, the
role provides a default implementation for all the other methods, so the only
one that has to be defined is precisely C<pull-one>, of which only a stub is
provided by the role. While C<Iterable> provides the high-level interface loops
will be working with, C<Iterator> provides the lower-level functions that will
be called in every iteration of the loop. Let's extend the previous example with
this role.

=begin code
class DNA does Iterable does Iterator {
    has $.chain;
    has Int $!index = 0;

    method new ($chain where {
                       $chain ~~ /^^ <[ACGT]>+ $$ / and
                       $chain.chars %% 3 } ) {
        self.bless( :$chain );
    }

    method iterator( ){ self }
    method pull-one( --> Mu){
        if $!index < $.chain.chars {
            my $codon = $.chain.comb.rotor(3)[$!index div 3];
            $!index += 3;
            return $codon;
        } else {
            return IterationEnd;
        }
    }
};

my $a := DNA.new('GAATCC');
.say for $a; # OUTPUT: «(G A A)␤(T C C)␤»
=end code

We declare a C<DNA> class which does the two roles, C<Iterator> and C<Iterable>;
the class will include a string that will be constrained to have a length that
is a multiple of 3 and composed only of ACGT.

Let us look at the
C<pull-one> method. This one is going to be called every time a new iteration
occurs, so it must keep the state of the last one. An C<$.index> attribute will
hold that state across invocations; C<pull-one> will check if the end of the
chain has been reached and will return the C<IterationEnd> constant provided by
the role. Implementing this low-level interface, in fact, simplifies the
implementation of the C<Iterable> interface. Now the iterator will be the object
itself, since we can call C<pull-one> on it to access every member in turn;
C<.iterator> will thus return just C<self>; this is possible since the object
will be, at the same time, C<Iterable> and C<Iterator>.

This need not always be the case, and in most cases C<.iterator> will have to
build an iterator type to be returned (that will, for instance, keep track of
the iteration state, which we are doing now in the main class), such as we did
in the previous example; however, this example shows the minimal code needed to
build a class that fulfills the iterator and iterable roles.

=head1 How to iterate: contextualizing and topic variables

C<for> and other loops place the item produced in every iteration into the
L<topic variable C<$_>|/language/variables#index-entry-topic_variable>, or
capture them into the variables that are declared along with the block. These
variables can be directly used inside the loop, without needing to declare them,
by using the
L<C<^> twigil|/syntax/$CIRCUMFLEX_ACCENT#(Traps_to_avoid)_twigil_^>.

Implicit iteration occurs when using the L<sequence operator|/language/operators#index-entry-..._operators>.

    say 1,1,1, { $^a²+2*$^b+$^c } … * > 300; # OUTPUT: «(1 1 1 4 7 16 46 127 475)

The generating block is being run once while the condition to finish the
sequence, in this case the term being bigger than 300, is not met. This has the
side effect of running a loop, but also creating a list that is output.

This can be done more systematically through the use of the L<C<gather/take>
blocks|/syntax/gather take>, which are a different kind of iterating construct
that instead of running in sink context, returns an item every iteration. This
L<Advent Calendar tutorial|https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/day-23-lazy-fruits-from-the-gather-of-eden/>
explains use cases for this kind of loops; in fact, gather is not so much a
looping construct, but a statement prefix that collects the items produced by
C<take> and creates a list out of them.

=head1 C<Classic> loops and why we do not like them

Classic C<for> loops, with a loop variable being incremented, can be done in
Raku through the L<C<loop> keyword|/language/control#loop>. Other
L<repeat|/language/control#repeat/while,_repeat/until> and
L<while|/language/control#while,_until> loops are also possible.

However, in general, they are discouraged. Raku is a functional and concurrent
language; when coding in Raku, you should look at loops in a functional way:
processing, one by one, the items produced by an iterator, that is, feeding an
item to a block without any kind of secondary effects. This functional view
allows also easy parallelization of the operation via the
L<C<hyper>|/routine/hyper> or L<C<race>|/routine/race> auto-threading methods.

If you feel more comfortable with your good old loops, the language allows you
to use them. However, it is considered better practice in Raku to try and use, whenever
possible, functional and concurrent iterating constructs.

I<Note:> Since version 6.d loops can produce a list of values from the values of last statements.

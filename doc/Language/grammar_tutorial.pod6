=TITLE Grammar Tutorial

=SUBTITLE Why Grammars?

Grammars parse strings and return data structures from those strings. Grammars can
be used to prepare a program for execution, to determine if a program can run at
all (if it's a valid program), to break down a web page into constituent parts,
or to identify the different parts of a sentence, among other things.

=SUBTITLE When Would I Use Grammars?

If you have strings to tame or interpret, grammars provide the
tools to do the job.

The string could be a file that you're looking to break into sections; perhaps a
protocol, like SMTP, where you need to specify which "commands" come after
what user-supplied data; maybe you're designing your own domain specific
language. Grammars can help.

=SUBTITLE The Broad Concept of Perl Grammars

Regular expressions work well for finding patterns in strings. However, for some
tasks -- like finding multiple patterns at once, or
combining patterns, or testing for patterns that may surround strings --
regular expressions, alone, are not enough.

When working with HTML, you could define a grammar to recognize HTML tags, both
the opening and closing elements, and the text in between. You could then
organize these elements into data structures, such as arrays or hashes.

=head1 Getting More Technical

=head2 The conceptual overview

Grammars are a special kind of class. You declare and define a grammar exactly
as you would any other class, except that you use the I<grammar> keyword instead
of I<class>.

    =begin code :skip-test
    grammar My::Gram { ... }
    =end code

Grammars are made up of methods that define a regex, a token, or a rule.
These are all varieties of different types of match methods. Once you have a
grammar defined, you call it and pass in a string for parsing.

    =begin code :skip-test
    my $matchObject = My::Gram.parse($string);
    =end code

Now, you may be wondering, if I have all these regexes defined that just return
their results, how does that help with parsing strings that may be ahead or backwards in a string, or things that need to be combined from many of
those regexes... and that's where grammar actions come in.

For every "method" you match in your grammar, you get an action you can use
to act on that match. You also get an over-arching action that you can use to
tie together all your matches and to build a data structure. This over-arching
method is called TOP by default.

=head2 The technical overview

As already mentioned, grammars are declared using the I<grammar> keyword and its
"methods" are declared with I<regex>, or I<token>, or I<rule>.

=item Regex methods are slow but thorough -- they will look back in the string
and really try.

=item Token methods are faster than regex methods and ignore whitespace.

=item Rule methods are the same as token methods except whitespace is not ignored.

When a method (regex, token or rule) matches in the grammar, that matched string
is put into a match object and keyed with the same name as the method.

    =begin code
    grammar My::Gram {
        token TOP { <thingy> .* }
        token thingy { 'clever_text_keyword' }
    }
    =end code

If you were to use my $match = My::Gram.parse( $string ) and your
string started with 'clever_text_keyword', you would get a match
object back that contained 'clever_text_keyword' keyed by the name of 'thingy'
in your match object.

The TOP method (whether regex, token, or rule) is the overarching pattern that must
match everything (by default). If the parsed string doesn't match the TOP regex,
your returned match object will be empty (Any).

As you can see above, in TOP, the "<thingy>" token is mentioned. The <thingy>
is defined on the next line, "token thingy...". That means that
'clever_text_keyword' B<must> be the first thing in the string or
the grammar parse will fail and we'll get an empty match. This is great for
recognizing a malformed string that should be discarded.

=head1 Learning By Example - a REST Contrivance

Let's suppose we'd like to parse a URI into the component parts that make up a
RESTful request. We want the URIs to work like this:

=item The first part of the URI will be the "subject", like a part, or a
product, or a person.

=item The second part of the URI will be the "command", the standard CRUD
functions (create, retrieve, update, or delete).

=item The third part of the URI will be arbitrary data, perhaps the specific ID
we'll be working with or a long list of data separated by "/"'s.

=item When we get a URI, we'll want 1-3 above to be placed into a data
structure that we can easily work with (and later enhance).

So, if we have "/product/update/7/notify", we would want
our grammar to give us a $match object that has a "I<subject>" of
"product", a "I<command>" of "update", and "I<data>" of "7/notify" (for now, anyway).

We'll start by defining a grammar class and some match methods for the
subject, command, and data. We'll use the token declarator since we don't care
about whitespace.

    =begin code
    grammar REST {
        token subject { \w+ }
        token command { \w+ }
        token data    { .* }
    }
    =end code

So far, this REST grammar says we want a subject that will be just I<word>
characters, a command that will be just I<word> characters, and data that will
be everything else left in the string.

Next, we'll want to arrange these matching tokens within the larger context of
the URI. That's what the TOP method allows us to do. We'll add the TOP method
and place the names of our tokens within it, together with the rest of the
patterns that makes up the overall pattern. Note how we're building a larger
regex from our named regexes.

    =begin code
    grammar REST {
        token TOP     { '/' <subject> '/' <command> '/' <data> }
        token subject { \w+ }
        token command { \w+ }
        token data    { .* }
    }
    =end code

With this code, we can already get the three parts of our RESTful request:

    =begin code :skip-test
    my $match = REST.parse('/product/update/7/notify');
    say $match;

    # OUTPUT: «｢/product/update/7/notify｣␤
    #          subject => ｢product｣
    #          command => ｢update｣
    #          data => ｢7/notify｣»
    =end code

The data can be accessed directly by using $match<subject> or
$match<command> or $match<data> to return the values parsed. They each contain
match objects that you can work further with, such as coercing into a string (
$match<command>.Str ).

=head2 Adding some flexibility

So far, the grammar will handle retrieves, deletes and updates. However,
a I<create> command doesn't have the third part (the I<data> portion). This
means the grammar will fail to match if we try to parse a create URI. To avoid
this, we need to make that last I<data> position match optional, along with the
'/' preceding it. This is accomplished by adding a question mark to the grouped
'/' and I<data> components of the TOP token, to indicate their optional nature,
just like a normal regex.

So, now we have:

    =begin code
    grammar REST {
        token TOP     { '/' <subject> '/' <command> [ '/' <data> ]? }
        token subject { \w+ }
        token command { \w+ }
        token data    { .* }
    }

    my $m = REST.parse('/product/create');
    say $m<subject>, $m<command>;

    # OUTPUT: «｢product｣｢create｣␤»
    =end code

Next, assume that the URIs will be entered manually by a user and that the user
might accidentally put spaces between the '/'s. If we wanted to accommodate for
this, we could replace the '/'s in TOP with a token that allowed for spaces.

    =begin code
    grammar REST {
        token TOP     { <slash><subject><slash><command>[<slash><data>]? }
        token subject { \w+ }
        token command { \w+ }
        token data    { .* }

        token slash   { \s* '/' \s* }
    }

    my $m = REST.parse('/ product / update /7 /notify');
    say $m;

    # OUTPUT: «｢/ product / update /7 /notify｣␤
    #          slash => ｢/ ｣
    #          subject => ｢product｣
    #          slash => ｢ / ｣
    #          command => ｢update｣
    #          slash => ｢ /｣
    #          data => ｢7 /notify｣»
    =end code

We're getting some extra junk in the match object now, with those slashes.
There's techniques to clean that up that we'll get to later.

=head2 Adding some constraints

We want our RESTful grammar to allow for CRUD operations only. Anything else we
want to fail to parse. That means our "command" above should have one of four
values: create, retrieve, update or delete.

There are several ways to accomplish this. For example, you could change the
command method:

    =begin code :skip-test
    token command { \w+ }

    # …becomes…

    token command { 'create'|'retrieve'|'update'|'delete' }
    =end code

For a URI to parse successfully, the second part of the string
between '/'s must be one of those CRUD values, otherwise the parsing fails.
Exactly what we want.

There's another technique that provides greater flexibility and improved
readability when options grow large: proto-regexes.

To utilize these proto-regexes (multimethods, in fact) to limit ourselves to the
valid CRUD options, we'll replace "token command" with the following:

    =begin code
    proto token command {*}
    token command:sym<create>   { <sym> }
    token command:sym<retrieve> { <sym> }
    token command:sym<update>   { <sym> }
    token command:sym<delete>   { <sym> }
    =end code

The 'sym' keyword is used to create the various proto-regex options. Each option
is named (e.g., sym<update>), and for that option's use, a special <sym> token is
auto-generated with the same name.

The <sym> token, as well as other user-defined tokens, may be used in the proto-
regex option block to define the specific 'match condition'. Regex tokens are
compiled forms and, once defined, cannot subsequently be modified by adverb
actions (e.g., :i). Therefore, as it's auto-generated, the special <sym> token
is useful only where an exact match of the option name is required.

If, for one of the proto-regex options, a match condition occurs, then the whole
proto's search terminates. The matching data, in the form of a match object, is
assigned to the parent proto token. If the special <sym> token was employed and
formed all or part of the actual match, then it's preserved as a sub-level in
the match object, otherwise it's absent.

Using proto-regexes like this gives us a lot of flexibility. For example,
instead of returning <sym>, which in this case is the entire string that was
matched, we could instead enter our own string, or do other funny stuff. We
could do the same with the "token subject" method and limit it also to only
parsing correctly on valid subjects (like 'part' or 'people', etc.).

=head2 Putting our RESTful grammar together

This is what we have for processing our RESTful URIs, so far:

    =begin code
    grammar REST
    {
        token TOP { <slash><subject><slash><command>[<slash><data>]? }

        proto token command {*}
        token command:sym<create>   { <sym> }
        token command:sym<retrieve> { <sym> }
        token command:sym<update>   { <sym> }
        token command:sym<delete>   { <sym> }

        token subject { \w+ }
        token data    { .* }
        token slash   { \s* '/' \s* }
    }
    =end code

Let's look at various URIs and see how they work with our grammar.

    =begin code :skip-test
    my @uris = ['/product/update/7/notify',
                '/product/create',
                '/item/delete/4'];

    for @uris -> $uri {
        my $m = REST.parse($uri);
        say "Sub: $m<subject> Cmd: $m<command> Dat: $m<data>";
    }

    # OUTPUT: «Sub: product Cmd: update Dat: 7/notify␤
    #          Sub: product Cmd: create Dat:
    #          Sub: item Cmd: delete Dat: 4»
    =end code

With just this part of a grammar, we're getting almost everything we're
looking for. The URIs get parsed and we get a data structure with the data.

The I<data> token returns the entire end of the URI as one string. The 4 is
fine. However from the '7/notify', we only want the 7. To get just the 7, we'll use
another feature of grammar classes: actions.

=head1 Grammar Actions

Grammar actions are used within grammar classes to do things with matches.
Actions are defined in their own classes, distinct from grammar classes.

You can think of grammar actions as a kind of plug-in expansion module for
grammars. A lot of the time you'll be happy using grammars all by their own.
But when you need to further process some of those strings, you can plug in the
Actions expansion module.

To work with actions, you use a named parameter called
"actions" which should contain an instance of your actions class. With the
code above, if our actions class called REST-actions, we would parse the
URI string like this:

    =begin code :skip-test
    my $matchObject = REST.parse($uri, actions => REST-actions.new);

    #   …or if you prefer…

    my $matchObject = REST.parse($uri, :actions(REST-actions.new));
    =end code

If you I<name your action methods with the same name as your grammar methods>
(tokens, regexes, rules), then when your grammar methods match, your action
method with the same name will get called automatically. The method will also be
passed the corresponding match object (represented by the $/ variable).

Let's turn to an example.

=head1 Grammars by Example with Actions

Here we are back to our grammar.

    =begin code
    grammar REST
    {
        token TOP { <slash><subject><slash><command>[<slash><data>]? }

        proto token command {*}
        token command:sym<create>   { <sym> }
        token command:sym<retrieve> { <sym> }
        token command:sym<update>   { <sym> }
        token command:sym<delete>   { <sym> }

        token subject { \w+ }
        token data    { .* }
        token slash   { \s* '/' \s* }
    }
    =end code

Recall that we want to further process the data token "7/notify", to get the 7.
To do this, we'll create an action class that has a method with the same name as
the named token. In this case, our token is named "data" so our method is also
named "data".

    =begin code
    class REST-actions
    {
        method data($/) { $/.split('/') }
    }
    =end code

Now when we pass the URI string through the grammar, the "data" token match
will be passed to the REST-actions' "data" method. The action method will split
the string by the '/' character and the first element of the returned
list will be the ID number (7 in the case of "7/notify").

But not really; there's a little more.

=head2 Keeping grammars with actions tidy with "make" and "made"

If the grammar calls the action above on data, the data method will be called,
but nothing will show up in the big TOP grammar match result returned to our
program. In order to make the action results show up, we need to call "make" on
that result. The result can be many things, including strings, array or
hash structures.

You can imagine that the "make" places the result in a special contained area
for a grammar. Everything that we "make" can be accessed later by "made".

So instead of the REST-actions class above, we should write

    =begin code
    class REST-actions
    {
        method data($/) { make $/.split('/') }
    }
    =end code

When we add "make" to the match split (which returns a list), the action will
return a data structure to the grammar that will be stored separately from
the "data" token of the original grammar. This way, we can work with both
if we need to.

If we want to access just the ID of 7 from that long URI, we access the first
element of the list returned from the "data" action that we "made" with "make":

    =begin code :skip-test
    my $uri = '/product/update/7/notify';

    my $match = REST.parse($uri, actions => REST-actions.new);

    say $match<data>.made[0];  # OUTPUT: «7␤»
    say $match<command>.Str;   # OUTPUT: «update␤»
    =end code

Here we call "made" on data, because we want the result of the action that
we "made" (with "make") to get the split array. That's lovely! But, wouldn't
it be lovelier if we could "make" a friendlier data structure that contained
all of the stuff we want, rather than having to coerce types and remember
arrays?

Just like TOP, which over-arches and matches the entire
string, actions have a TOP method as well. We can "make" all of the
individual match components, like "data" or "subject" or "command", and then we
can place them in a data structure that we will "make" in
TOP. When we return the final match object, we can
then access this data structure.

To do this, we add the method TOP to the action class and "make" whatever data
structure we like from the component pieces.

So, our action class becomes:

    =begin code
    class REST-actions
    {
        method TOP ($/) {
            make { subject => $<subject>.Str,
                   command => $<command>.Str,
                   data    => $<data>.made }
        }

        method data($/) { make $/.split('/') }
    }
    =end code

Here in the TOP method, the "subject" remains the same as the subject we
matched in the grammar. Also, "command" returns the valid <sym> that was
matched (create, update, retrieve, or delete). We coerce each into .Str, as
well, since we don't need the full match object.

We want to make sure to use the "made" method on the
$<data> object, since we want to access the split one that we "made" with
"make" in our action, rather than the proper $<data> object.

After we "make" something in the TOP method of a grammar action, we can then
access all the custom values by calling the "made" method on the grammar
result object. The code now becomes

    =begin code :skip-test
    my $uri = '/product/update/7/notify';

    my $match = REST.parse($uri, actions => REST-actions.new);

    my $rest = $match.made;
    say $rest<data>[0];   # OUTPUT: «7␤»
    say $rest<command>;   # OUTPUT: «update␤»
    say $rest<subject>;   # OUTPUT: «product␤»
    =end code

If the complete return match object is not needed, you could return only the made
data from your action's TOP.

    =begin code :skip-test
    my $uri = '/product/update/7/notify';

    my $rest = REST.parse($uri, actions => REST-actions.new).made;

    say $rest<data>[0];   # OUTPUT: «7␤»
    say $rest<command>;   # OUTPUT: «update␤»
    say $rest<subject>;   # OUTPUT: «product␤»
    =end code

Oh, did we forget to get rid of that ugly array element number? Hmm. Let's make
something new in the grammar's custom return in TOP... how about we call it
"subject-id" and have it set to element 0 of <data>.

    =begin code
    class REST-actions
    {
        method TOP ($/) {
            make { subject    => $<subject>.Str,
                   command    => $<command>.Str,
                   data       => $<data>.made,
                   subject-id => $<data>.made[0] }
        }

        method data($/) { make $/.split('/') }
    }
    =end code

Now we can do this instead

    =begin code :skip-test
    my $uri = '/product/update/7/notify';

    my $rest = REST.parse($uri, actions => REST-actions.new).made;

    say $rest<command>;    # OUTPUT: «update␤»
    say $rest<subject>;    # OUTPUT: «product␤»
    say $rest<subject-id>; # OUTPUT: «7␤»
    =end code

Here's the final code:

    =begin code
    grammar REST
    {
        token TOP { <slash><subject><slash><command>[<slash><data>]? }

        proto token command {*}
        token command:sym<create>   { <sym> }
        token command:sym<retrieve> { <sym> }
        token command:sym<update>   { <sym> }
        token command:sym<delete>   { <sym> }

        token subject { \w+ }
        token data    { .* }
        token slash   { \s* '/' \s* }
    }


    class REST-actions
    {
        method TOP ($/) {
            make { subject    => $<subject>.Str,
                   command    => $<command>.Str,
                   data       => $<data>.made,
                   subject-id => $<data>.made[0] }
        }

        method data($/) { make $/.split('/') }
    }
    =end code

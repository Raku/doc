=TITLE Pod6

=SUBTITLE An easy-to-use markup language for documenting Raku modules and programs

Pod6 is an easy-to-use markup language. It can be used for
writing language documentation, for documenting programs and modules, as
well as for other types of document composition.

Every Pod6 document has to begin with C<=begin pod> and end with C<=end pod>.
Everything between these two delimiters will be processed and used to generate
documentation.

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=begin pod

A very simple Pod6 document

=end pod
=end code

=head1 Block structure

A Pod6 document may consist of multiple Pod6 blocks. There are four ways to
define a block: delimited, paragraph, abbreviated, and declarator; the first three
yield the same result but the fourth differs. You can use whichever form is most
convenient for your particular documentation task.

=head2 Delimited blocks

Delimited blocks are bounded by C<=begin> and C<=end> markers, both of
which are followed by a valid Raku identifier, which is the
C<typename> of the block. Typenames that are entirely lowercase (for
example: C<=begin head1>) or entirely uppercase (for example: C<=begin
SYNOPSIS>) are reserved.

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=begin head1
Top Level Heading
=end head1
=end code

=head3 Configuration information

After the typename, the rest of the C<=begin> marker line is treated as
configuration information for the block. This information is used in
different ways by different types of blocks, but is always specified using
Raku-ish option pairs. That is, any of:

=begin table
 Value is...       Specify with...           Or with...           Or with...
 ===============   ===================       ==============       ===========
 List              :key[$e1, $e2, ...]       :key($e1, $e2, ...)  :key<$e1 $e2 ...>
 Hash              :key{$k1=>$v1, $k2=>$v2}
 Boolean (true)    :key                      :key(True)           :key[True]
 Boolean (false)   :!key                     :key(False)          :key[False]
 String            :key<str>                 :key('str')          :key("str")
 Int               :key(42)                  :key[42]             :42key
 Number            :key(2.3)                 :key[2.3]
=end table

Where '$e1, $e2, ...' are list elements of type String, Int, Number, or
Boolean. Lists may have mixed element types. Note that one-element
lists are converted to the type of their element (String, Int, Number, or
Boolean). Also note that big integers can be used if required.

For hashes, '$k1, $k2, ...' are keys of type Str and '$v1, $v2, ...'
are values of type String, Int, Number, or Boolean.

Strings are delimited by single or double quotes. Whitespace is not significant
outside of strings. Hash keys need not be quote-delimited unless they contain
significant whitespace. Strings entered inside angle brackets become lists if
any whitespace is used inside the angle brackets.

All option keys and values must, of course, be constants since Pod6 is a
specification language, not a programming language. Specifically, option
values cannot be closures. See L<Synopsis 2|https://design.raku.org/S02.html>
for details of the various
Raku pair notations.

IN the future, the configuration section may be extended over subsequent
lines by
starting those lines with an C<=> in the first (virtual) column followed
by a whitespace character. N<This feature is not yet completely implemented.
All configuration information currently must be provided on the same
line as the C<=begin> marker line or C<=for name> for paragraph blocks.>

Some of these options have a predetermined value; specifically, C<:numbered>
is used to specify that the block item or lines will be numbered.

=for code
=for defn :numbered
               We
               Need
               Numbers
say $=pod[0].config<numbered>; # OUTPUT: «True␤»

This configuration option can be abbreviated by a hash mark

=for code
=para #
We
Need
Numbers
say $=pod[0].config<numbered>; # OUTPUT: «1␤»

=head2 Paragraph blocks

Paragraph blocks begin by a C<=for> marker and end by
the next Pod6 directive or the first blank line.
The C<=for> marker is followed by the C<typename> of the block
plus, optionally, any configuration data as in the delimited
blocks described above.

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=for head1
Top Level Heading
=end code

=head2 Abbreviated blocks

Abbreviated blocks begin by an C<'='> sign, which is followed immediately by the
C<typename> of the block. All following data are part of the contents of the
block, thus configuration data B<cannot> be specified for an I<abbreviated>
block. The block ends at the next Pod6 directive or the first blank line.

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=head1 Top level heading
=end code

X<|declarator blocks,#|>X<|declarator blocks,#=>
=head2 Declarator blocks

Declarator blocks differ from the others by not having a specific type,
instead they are attached to some source code.

Declarator blocks are introduced by a special comment: either C<#|> or C<#=>,
which must be immediately followed by either a space or an opening curly brace.
If followed by a space, the block is terminated by the end of line;
if followed by one or more opening curly braces, the block is terminated by
the matching sequence of closing curly braces.

Blocks starting with C<#|> are attached to the code after them,
and blocks starting with C<#=> are attached to the code before them.

Since declarator blocks are attached to source code, they can be used to
document classes, roles, subroutines and in general any statement or block.

The C<WHY> method can be used on these classes, roles, subroutines etc. to
return the attached Pod6 value.

=begin code
#| Base class for magicians
class Magician {
  has Int $.level;
  has Str @.spells;
}

#| Fight mechanics
sub duel(Magician $a, Magician $b) {
}
#= Magicians only, no mortals.

say Magician.WHY; # OUTPUT: «Base class for magicians␤»
say &duel.WHY.leading; # OUTPUT: «Fight mechanics␤»
say &duel.WHY.trailing; # OUTPUT: «Magicians only, no mortals.␤»
=end code

These declarations can extend multiple blocks:

=begin code
#|( This is an example of stringification:
    * Numbers turn into strings
    * Regexes operate on said strings
    * C<with> topicalizes and places result into $_
)
sub search-in-seq( Int $end, Int $number ) {
    with (^$end).grep( /^$number/ ) {
        .say for $_<>;
    }
}
#=« Uses
    * topic
    * decont operator
»
=end code

By using a matched pair of parenthesis constructs such as C<()> or C<«»> the
comments can extend multiple lines. This format will not normally translate to
a multi-line display by C<raku --doc>. However, since Rakudo version 2020.01,
there is a method to accomplish that, I<for leading declarator blocks only>,
by defining a special environment variable: B<C<RAKUDO_POD_DECL_BLOCK_USER_FORMAT>>.
When that value is set, running C<raku> with the C<--doc> option should show text
from leading declarator blocks in its original format. See the test for the capability
in the new file C<https://perl6/roast/S26-documentation/block-leading-user-format.t>.



=head1 Block types

Pod6 offers a wide range of standard block types.

=head2 Headings

Headings can be defined using C<=headN>,
where N is greater than zero (e.g., C<=head1>, C<=head2>, …).

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=head1 A top level heading

=head2 A second level heading

=head3 A third level heading
=end code

=head2 Ordinary paragraphs

An ordinary paragraph consists of text that is to be formatted into a document
at the current level of nesting, with whitespace squeezed, lines filled, and any
special inline mark-up applied.

Ordinary paragraphs consist of one or more consecutive lines of text,
each of which starts with a non-whitespace character.
The paragraph is terminated by the first blank line or block directive.

For example:

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=head1 This is a heading block

This is an ordinary paragraph.
Its text  will   be     squeezed     and
short lines filled. It is terminated by
the first blank line.

This is another ordinary paragraph.
Its     text    will  also be squeezed and
short lines filled. It is terminated by
the trailing directive on the next line.

=head2 This is another heading block

This is yet another ordinary paragraph,
at the first virtual column set by the
previous directive
=end code

Ordinary paragraphs do not require an explicit marker or delimiters.

Alternatively, there is also an explicit C<=para> marker that can be used
to explicitly mark a paragraph.

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=para
This is an ordinary paragraph.
Its text  will   be     squeezed     and
short lines filled.
=end code

In addition, the longer C<=begin para> and C<=end para> form can be used.

For example:

=begin code :lang<pod6>

=begin para
This is an ordinary paragraph.
Its text  will   be     squeezed     and
short lines filled.

This is still part of the same paragraph,
which continues until an...
=end para
=end code

As demonstrated by the previous example, within a delimited C<=begin para> and
C<=end para> block, any blank lines are preserved.

=head2 Code blocks

Code blocks are used to specify source code, which should be rendered without
re-justification, without whitespace-squeezing, and without recognizing any
inline formatting codes. Typically these blocks are used to show examples of
code, mark-up, or other textual specifications, and are rendered using a
fixed-width font.

A code block may be implicitly specified as one or more lines of text,
each of which starts with a whitespace character. The implicit code block
is then terminated by a blank line.

For example:

=begin code :lang<pod6>
This ordinary paragraph introduces a code block:

    my $name = 'John Doe';
    say $name;
=end code

Code blocks can also be explicitly defined by enclosing them in C<=begin code>
and C<=end code>

=begin code :lang<pod6>
    =begin code
    my $name = 'John Doe';
    say $name;
    =end code
=end code

=head2 I/O blocks

Pod6 provides blocks for specifying the input and output of programs.

The C<=input> block is used to specify pre-formatted keyboard input,
which should be rendered without re-justification or squeezing of whitespace.

The C<=output> block is used to specify pre-formatted terminal or file output,
which should also be rendered without re-justification or whitespace-squeezing.

=head2 Lists

=head3 Unordered lists

Lists in Pod6 are specified as a series of C<=item> blocks.

For example:

=begin code :lang<pod6>
The three suspects are:

=item  Happy
=item  Sleepy
=item  Grumpy
=end code

The three suspects are:

=item  Happy
=item  Sleepy
=item  Grumpy

=head3 Definition lists

Lists that define terms or commands use C<=defn>, equivalent to the C<DL> lists
in HTML

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=defn Happy
When you're not blue.

=defn Blue
When you're not happy.
=end code

will be rendered as

=defn Happy
When you're not blue.

=defn Blue
When you're not happy.

=head3 Multi-level lists

Lists may be multi-level, with items at each level specified using the
C<=item1>, C<=item2>, C<=item3>, etc. blocks.

Note that C<=item> is just an abbreviation for C<=item1>.

For example:

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=item1  Animal
=item2     Vertebrate
=item2     Invertebrate

=item1  Phase
=item2     Solid
=item2     Liquid
=item2     Gas
=end code

=item1  Animal
=item2     Vertebrate
=item2     Invertebrate

=item1  Phase
=item2     Solid
=item2     Liquid
=item2     Gas

=head3 Multi-paragraph lists

Using the delimited form of the C<=item> block (C<=begin item> and C<=end item>),
we can specify items that contain multiple paragraphs.

For example:

=begin code :lang<pod6>
Let's consider two common proverbs:

=begin item
I<The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.>

This is a common myth and an unconscionable slur on the Spanish
people, the majority of whom are extremely attractive.
=end item

=begin item
I<The early bird gets the worm.>

In deciding whether to become an early riser, it is worth
considering whether you would actually enjoy annelids
for breakfast.
=end item

As you can see, folk wisdom is often of dubious value.
=end code
Renders as:

Let's consider two common proverbs:

=begin item
I<The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.>

This is a common myth and an unconscionable slur on the Spanish
people, the majority of whom are extremely attractive.
=end item

=begin item
I<The early bird gets the worm.>

In deciding whether to become an early riser, it is worth
considering whether you would actually enjoy annelids
for breakfast.
=end item

As you can see, folk wisdom is often of dubious value.

=head2 Tables

Check out this page for documentation related to L<Tables|/language/tables>
Z<Eventually copy everything from tables.pod6 and put it here>

=head2 Pod6 comments

Pod6 comments are comments that Pod6 renderers ignore.

Comments are useful for I<meta>documentation (documenting the documentation).
Single-line comments use the C<=comment> marker:

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=comment Add more here about the algorithm
=end code

For multi-line comments, use a delimited C<comment> block:

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=begin comment
This comment is
multi-line.
=end comment
=end code

=head2 Semantic blocks

All uppercase block typenames are reserved for specifying standard
documentation, publishing, source components, or metainformation.

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=NAME
=AUTHOR
=VERSION
=TITLE
=SUBTITLE
=end code

=head1 Formatting codes

Formatting codes provide a way to add inline mark-up to a piece of text.

All Pod6 formatting codes consist of a single capital letter followed immediately
by a set of single or double angle brackets; Unicode double angle brackets may
be used.

Formatting codes may nest other formatting codes.

The following codes are available: B<B>, B<C>, B<E>, B<I>, B<K>, B<L>, B<N>,
B<P>, B<R>, B<T>, B<U>, B<V>, B<X>, and B<Z>.

=head2 Bold

To format a text in bold enclose it in C<B< >>
=for code :lang<pod6>
Raku is B<awesome>

Raku is B<awesome>

=head2 Italic

To format a text in italic enclose it in C<I< >>
=for code :lang<pod6>
Raku is I<awesome>

Raku is I<awesome>

=head2 Underlined

To underline a text enclose it in C<U< >>
=for code :lang<pod6>
Raku is U<awesome>

Z<If used will bust Pod::To::BigPage>

=head2 Code

To flag text as code and treat it verbatim enclose it in C<C< >>
=for code :lang<pod6>
C<my $var = 1; say $var;>

C<my $var = 1; say $var;>

=head2 Links

To create a link enclose it in C<L< >>

A vertical bar (optional) separates label and target.

The target location can be an URL (first example) or a local Pod6 document
(second example). Local file names are relative to the base of the project, not
the current document.

=for code :lang<pod6>
Raku homepage L<https://raku.org>
L<Raku homepage|https://raku.org>

Raku homepage L<https://raku.org>

L<Raku homepage|https://raku.org>

=for code :lang<pod6>
Structure L</language/about#Structure|/language/about#Structure>
L<Structure|/language/about#Structure>

Structure L</language/about#Structure|/language/about#Structure>

L<Structure|/language/about#Structure>

To create a link to a section in the same document:
=for code :lang<pod6>
Comments L<#Comments>
L<Comments|#Comments>

Comments L<#Comments>

L<Comments|#Comments>

=head2 Placement links

This code is not implemented in C<Pod::To::HTML>, but is partially implemented
in C<Pod::To::BigPage>.

A second kind of link E<mdash> the C<P<>> or B<placement link> E<mdash> works
in the opposite direction. Instead of directing focus out to another
document, it allows you to assimilate the contents of another document
into your own.

In other words, the C<P<>> formatting code takes a URI and (where possible)
inserts the contents of the corresponding document inline in place of the
code itself.

C<P<>> codes are handy for breaking out standard elements of
your documentation set into reusable components that can then be
incorporated directly into multiple documents. For example:

=begin code :lang<pod6>
=COPYRIGHT
P<file:/shared/docs/std_copyright.pod>

=DISCLAIMER
P<http://www.MegaGigaTeraPetaCorp.com/std/disclaimer.txt>
=end code

might produce:

=begin nested
B<Copyright>

This document is copyright (c) MegaGigaTeraPetaCorp, 2006. All rights reserved.

B<Disclaimer>

ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY IS IMPLIED. NOT EVEN OF ANY KIND. WE HAVE SOLD
YOU THIS SOFTWARE WITH NO HINT OF A SUGGESTION THAT IT IS EITHER USEFUL
OR USABLE. AS FOR GUARANTEES OF CORRECTNESS...DON'T MAKE US LAUGH! AT
SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE WE MIGHT DEIGN TO SELL YOU UPGRADES THAT PURPORT
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE APPLICATION'S MANY DEFICIENCIES, BUT NO PROMISES
THERE EITHER. WE HAVE MORE LAWYERS ON STAFF THAN YOU HAVE TOTAL
EMPLOYEES, SO DON'T EVEN *THINK* ABOUT SUING US. HAVE A NICE DAY.
=end nested

If a renderer cannot find or access the external data source for a
placement link, it must issue a warning and render the URI directly in
some form, possibly as an outwards link. For example:

=begin nested
B<Copyright>

See: C<file:/shared/docs/std_copyright.pod>

B<Disclaimer>

See: C<http://www.MegaGigaTeraPetaCorp.com/std/disclaimer.txt>
=end nested

You can use any of the following URI forms (see L<#Links>) in a
placement link.

=head2 Comments

A comment is text that is never rendered.

To create a comment enclose it in C<Z< >>
=for code :lang<pod6>
Raku is awesome Z<Of course it is!>

Raku is awesome Z<Of course it is!>

=head2 Notes

Notes are rendered as footnotes.

To create a note enclose it in C<N< >>
=for code :lang<pod6>
Raku is multi-paradigmatic N<Supporting Procedural, Object Oriented, and Functional programming>

Z<Raku is multi-paradigmatic N<Supporting Procedural, Object Oriented, and Functional programming> >

=head2 Keyboard input

To flag text as keyboard input enclose it in C<K< >>
=for code :lang<pod6>
Enter your name K<John Doe>

Z<If used will bust Pod::To::BigPage>

=head2 Replaceable

The C<R<>> formatting code specifies that the contained text is a
B<replaceable item>, a placeholder, or a metasyntactic variable. It is
used to indicate a component of a syntax or specification that should
eventually be replaced by an actual value. For example:

The basic C<ln> command is: C<ln> R<source_file> R<target_file>

or:

=begin code :allow<R> :lang<pod6>
Then enter your details at the prompt:

=for input
    Name: R<your surname>
      ID: R<your employee number>
    Pass: R<your 36-letter password>
=end code

=head2 Terminal output

To flag text as terminal output enclose it in C<T< >>
=for code :lang<pod6>
Hello T<John Doe>

Z<If used will bust Pod::To::BigPage>

=head2 Unicode

To include Unicode code points or HTML5 character references in a Pod6 document,
enclose them in C<E< >>

C<E< >> can enclose a number, which is treated as the decimal Unicode
value for the desired code point. It can also enclose explicit binary, octal,
decimal, or hexadecimal numbers using the Raku notations for explicitly based
numbers.

=begin code :lang<pod6>
Raku makes considerable use of the E<171> and E<187> characters.

Raku makes considerable use of the E<laquo> and E<raquo> characters.

Raku makes considerable use of the E<0b10101011> and E<0b10111011> characters.

Raku makes considerable use of the E<0o253> and E<0o273> characters.

Raku makes considerable use of the E<0d171> and E<0d187> characters.

Raku makes considerable use of the E<0xAB> and E<0xBB> characters.
=end code

Raku makes considerable use of the « and » characters.

=head2 Verbatim text

This code is not implemented by C<Pod::To::HTML>, but is implemented in
C<Pod::To::BigPage>.

The C<V<>> formatting code treats its entire contents as being B<verbatim>,
disregarding every apparent formatting code within it. For example:

=for code :lang<pod6>
The B<V< V<> >> formatting code disarms other codes
such as V< I<>, C<>, B<>, and M<> >.

Note, however that the C<V<>> code only changes the way its
contents are parsed, I<not> the way they are rendered. That is, the
contents are still wrapped and formatted like plain text, and the
effects of any formatting codes surrounding the C<V<>> code
are still applied to its contents. For example the previous example
is rendered as:

=nested
The B<V< V<> >> formatting code disarms other codes
such as V< I<>, C<>, B<>, and M<> >.

=head2 Indexing terms

Anything enclosed in an C<X<>> code is an B<index entry>. The contents
of the code are both formatted into the document and used as the
(case-insensitive) index entry:

=begin code :allow<B> :lang<pod6>
An B<X<array>> is an ordered list of scalars indexed by number,
starting with 0. A B<X<hash>> is an unordered collection of scalar
values indexed by their associated string key.
=end code

You can specify an index entry in which the indexed text and the index
entry are different, by separating the two with a vertical bar:

=begin code :allow<B> :lang<pod6>
An B<X<array|arrays>> is an ordered list of scalars indexed by number,
starting with 0. A B<X<hash|hashes>> is an unordered collection of
scalar values indexed by their associated string key.
=end code

In the two-part form, the index entry comes after the bar and is
case-sensitive.

You can specify hierarchical index entries by separating indexing levels
with commas:

=begin code :allow<B> :lang<pod6>
An X<array|B<arrays, definition of>> is an ordered list of scalars
indexed by number, starting with 0. A X<hash|B<hashes, definition of>>
is an unordered collection of scalar values indexed by their
associated string key.
=end code

You can specify two or more entries for a single indexed text, by separating
the entries with semicolons:

=begin code :allow<B> :lang<pod6>
A X<hash|B<hashes, definition of; associative arrays>>
is an unordered collection of scalar values indexed by their
associated string key.
=end code

The indexed text can be empty, creating a "zero-width" index entry:

=begin code :allow<B> :lang<pod6>
B<X<|puns, deliberate>>This is called the "Orcish Maneuver"
because you "OR" the "cache".
=end code

=head1 Rendering Pod

=head2 HTML

In order to generate HTML from Pod, you need the
L<Pod::To::HTML module|https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-HTML>.

If it is not already installed, install it by running the following command:
C<zef install Pod::To::HTML>

Once installed, run the following command in the terminal:
=begin code :lang<shell>
perl6 --doc=HTML input.pod6 > output.html
=end code

=head2 Markdown

In order to generate Markdown from Pod, you need
the L<Pod::To::Markdown module|https://github.com/softmoth/perl6-pod-to-markdown>.

If it is not already installed, install it by running the following command:
C<zef install Pod::To::Markdown>

Once installed, run the following command in the terminal:
=begin code :lang<shell>
perl6 --doc=Markdown input.pod6 > output.md
=end code

=head2 Text

In order to generate text from Pod, you can use the default
C<Pod::To::Text> module.

Using the terminal, run the following command:
=begin code :lang<shell>
perl6 --doc=Text input.pod6 > output.txt
=end code

You can omit the C<=Text> portion:

=begin code :lang<shell>
perl6 --doc input.pod6 > output.txt
=end code

You can even embed Pod6 directly in your program and add the
traditional Unix command line "--man" option to your program with a
multi MAIN subroutine like this:

=begin code
multi MAIN(Bool :$man) {
    run $*EXECUTABLE, '--doc', $*PROGRAM;
}
=end code

Now C<myprogram --man> will output your Pod6 rendered as a man page.

=head1 Accessing Pod

In order to access Pod6 documentation from within a Raku program the
special C<=> twigil, as documented
in the L<variables section|/language/variables#The_=_twigil>, must be used.

The C<=> twigil provides the introspection over the Pod6 structure,
providing a L<Pod::Block|/type/Pod::Block> tree root from which it is possible
to access the whole structure of the Pod6 document.

As an example, the following piece of code introspects
its own Pod6 documentation:

=begin code
=begin pod

=head1 This is a head1 title

This is a paragraph.

=head2 Subsection

Here some text for the subsection.

=end pod

for $=pod -> $pod-item {
    for $pod-item.contents -> $pod-block {
      $pod-block.raku.say;
    }
}
=end code

producing the following output:

=for code
Pod::Heading.new(level => 1, config => {}, contents => [Pod::Block::Para.new(config => {}, contents => ["This is a head1 title"])]);
Pod::Block::Para.new(config => {}, contents => ["This is a paragraph."]);
Pod::Heading.new(level => 2, config => {}, contents => [Pod::Block::Para.new(config => {}, contents => ["Subsection"])]);
Pod::Block::Para.new(config => {}, contents => ["Here some text for the subsection."]);
=end pod

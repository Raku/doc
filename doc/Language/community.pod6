=TITLE Community

=SUBTITLE Information about the people working on and using Raku

=head1 Overview

"Perl 5 was my rewrite of Perl.  I want Perl 6 to be the community's rewrite
of Perl and of the community." - Larry Wall (circa 2000)

"I am in favor of this change [a community driven renaming from Perl 6 to Raku], because it reflects an ancient wisdom:
'No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from
the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins.
If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.
No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.'" - Larry Wall

=head1 The Raku community

=head2 Online communities

L<IRC|/language/glossary#index-entry-IRC> communication has played an integral role in the Raku community for more than a decade. There are various channels for Raku-related activities on C<libera.chat>. There are several L<bots|/language/glossary#Bot> to make IRC activity more convenient and fun. You can read about IRC content L<here|https://raku.org/community/irc/> in greater details.

L<The Raku Discord server|https://discord.gg/VzYpdQ6> serves a similar purpose. Thanks to the bridges written by fellow Raku members, it integrates well with the main IRC channels.

L<StackOverflow|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/raku> is also a great
resource for asking questions and helping others with their Raku problems and
challenges.

More resources can be found in the
L<raku.org community page|https://raku.org/community/>.

=head2 Offline communities

Raku is also a common topic at
L<Perl conferences|https://www.perl.org/events.html> and
L<Perl Monger meetings|https://www.pm.org/>.
If you prefer in-person meetings, these are warmly recommended!

=head2 Other resources

L<Camelia|https://raku.org/>, the multi-color butterfly with P 6 in her wings, is the symbol of this diverse and welcoming community.

=head1 Rakudo Weekly

Elizabeth Mattijsen usually posts in L<the "Rakudo Weekly" blog|https://rakudoweekly.blog/>, a summary of Raku posts, tweets, comments and other interesting tidbits.
If you want a single resource to know what is going on in the Raku community now, this is your best resource.

Historical articles (pre name change) can be found archived on
L<the "Perl 6 Weekly" blog|https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/>.

=head1 Raku Advent calendar

The Raku community publishes every December an
L<Advent Calendar|https://raku-advent.blog/>, with Raku tutorials every day until
Christmas. Previous calendars (pre name change) are
L<still available|https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/> and relevant.

Organization and assignment of days is done through the different Raku channels and the
L<Raku/advent|https://github.com/Raku/advent> repository. If you want to
participate, its organization starts by the end of October, so check out
the channels above to keep up to date.

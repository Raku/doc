=head1 Getting arguments through the command line

The simplest way is to use the L<C<@*ARGS>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AARGS> variable to obtain arguments from the command line; this array will contain the strings that follow the program name. L<C<%*ENV>|/language/variables#Runtime_Environment> will contain the environment variables, so that if you use:

=begin code :lang<shell>
export API_KEY=1967196417966160761fabc1511067
./consume_api.p6
=end code

You can use them from your program this way:

    my $api-key = %*ENV<API_KEY> // die "Need the API key";

This will fail if the environment variable C<API_KEY> has not been defined previously.

Perl 6 has a better way to deal with command line arguments if they represent file names: the L<C<$*ARGFILES>/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AARGFILES> dynamic variable.


=head1 Running programs synchronous and asynchronously

There are two routines to run external programs:

=head1 Making operating system calls through the native API

=TITLE Quoting constructs

=SUBTITLE Writing strings and word lists, in Raku

=head1 The Q lang

Strings are usually represented in Raku code using some form of quoting
construct. The most minimalistic of these is C<Q>, usable via the shortcut
C<｢…｣>, or via C<Q> followed by any pair of delimiters surrounding your
text, including many
L<Unicode pairs|https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/aa4994a7f6b3f6b450a9d231bebd5fba172439b0/S02-literals/quoting-unicode.t#L49-L65>.
Most of the time, though, the most you'll need is
C<'…'>
 or C<"…">,
described in more detail in the following sections.

For information about quoting as applied in regexes, see the L<regular
expression documentation|/language/regexes>.

=head2 X<Literal strings: Q|Syntax,Q;Syntax,｢ ｣>

=for code :skip-test<listing>
Q[A literal string]
｢More plainly.｣
Q^Almost any non-word character can be a delimiter!^
Q｢｢Delimiters can be repeated/nested if they are adjacent.｣｣
Q｟Quoting with fancy unicode pairs｠

Delimiters can be nested, but in the plain C<Q> form, backslash escapes
aren't allowed. In other words, basic C<Q> strings are as literal as
possible.

Some delimiters are not allowed immediately after C<Q>, C<q>, or C<qq>. Any
characters that are allowed in L<identifiers|/language/syntax#Identifiers> are
not allowed to be used, since in such a case, the quoting construct together
with such characters are interpreted as an identifier. In addition, C<( )> is
not allowed because that is interpreted as a function call. If you still wish
to use those characters as delimiters, separate them from C<Q>, C<q>, or C<qq>
with a space. Please note that some natural languages use a left delimiting
quote on the right side of a string. C<Q> will not support those as it relies
on unicode properties to tell left and right delimiters apart.

=for code :skip-test<listing>
Q'this will not work!'
Q(this won't work either!)

The examples above will produce an error. However, this will work

=for code :skip-test<listing>
Q (this is fine, because of space after Q)
Q 'and so is this'
Q<Make sure you <match> opening and closing delimiters>
Q{This is still a closing curly brace → \}

These examples produce:

=begin code :solo
this is fine, because of space after Q
and so is this
Make sure you <match> opening and closing delimiters
This is still a closing curly brace → \
=end code

The behavior of quoting constructs can be modified with adverbs, as explained
in detail in later sections.

=begin table
Short       Long            Meaning

:x          :exec           Execute as command and return results

:w          :words          Split result on words (no quote protection)

:ww         :quotewords     Split result on words (with quote protection)

:q          :single         Interpolate \\, \qq[...] and escaping the delimiter with \

:qq         :double         Interpolate with :s, :a, :h, :f, :c, :b

:s          :scalar         Interpolate $ vars

:a          :array          Interpolate @ vars (when followed by postcircumfix)

:h          :hash           Interpolate % vars (when followed by postcircumfix)

:f          :function       Interpolate & calls

:c          :closure        Interpolate {...} expressions

:b          :backslash      Enable backslash escapes (\n, \qq, \$foo, etc)

:to         :heredoc        Parse result as heredoc terminator

:v          :val            Convert to allomorph if possible
=end table

These adverbs can be used together with C<Q>, so that it will interpolate
even if the quoting operator does not:

=for code
my %þ = :is-mighty;
say Q "Þor %þ<>";                         # OUTPUT: «Þor %þ<>␤»
say Q:h"Þor %þ<>";                        # OUTPUT: «Þor is-mighty   True␤»
%þ = :42foo, :33bar;
say Q:h:c "Þor %þ<> →  { [+] %þ.values}"; # OUTPUT: «Þor bar 33␤foo  42 →  75␤»
my @þ= <33 44>; say Q:a "Array contains @þ[]"; # OUTPUT: «Array contains 33 44␤»
say Q:v<33> + 3;                          # OUTPUT: «36␤»

By default, and as shown, C<Q> quotes directly without any kind of
transformation of the quoted string. The adverbs will modify its behavior,
converting, for instance, the string into an allomorph (with the C<:v> adverb)
or allowing interpolation of hashes (via C<:h>) or C<{}> code sections (via
C<:c>). Arrays and hashes must be I<followed by a postcircumfix>; that is, the
sigiled identifier will not interpolate, but followed by an indexing, decont
operator or a method call with parentheses, it will:

=for code
my @þ= <33 44>;
say Q:a "Array contains @þ.elems()"; # OUTPUT: «Array contains 2␤»

The same code without the parentheses will simply not interpolate, absent the
post-circumfix operator.

X<|Syntax,escaping quote>
=head2 X<Escaping: q|Syntax,q;Syntax,' '>

=begin code
'Very plain';
q[This back\slash stays];
q[This back\\slash stays]; # Identical output
q{This is not a closing curly brace → \}, but this is → };
Q :q $There are no backslashes here, only lots of \$\$\$!$;
'(Just kidding. There\'s no money in that string)';
'No $interpolation {here}!';
Q:q!Just a literal "\n" here!;
=end code

The C<q> form allows for escaping characters that would otherwise end the
string using a backslash. The backslash itself can be escaped, too, as in
the third example above. The usual form is C<'…'> or C<q> followed by a
delimiter, but it's also available as an adverb on C<Q>, as in the fifth and
last example above.

These examples produce:
=for code :lang<text>
Very plain
This back\slash stays
This back\slash stays
This is not a closing curly brace → } but this is →
There are no backslashes here, only lots of $$$!
(Just kidding. There's no money in that string)
No $interpolation {here}!
Just a literal "\n" here

The C<\qq[...]> escape sequence enables
L«C<qq> interpolation|/language/quoting#Interpolation:_qq» for a portion
of the string. Using this escape sequence is handy when you have HTML markup
in your strings, to avoid interpretation of angle brackets as hash keys:

    my $var = 'foo';
    say '<code>$var</code> is <var>\qq[$var.uc()]</var>';
    # OUTPUT: «<code>$var</code> is <var>FOO</var>␤»

=head2 X<Interpolation: qq|Syntax,qq;Syntax," ">

=begin code
my $color = 'blue';
say "My favorite color is $color!"; # OUTPUT: «My favorite color is blue!␤»
=end code

X<|Syntax,\ (quoting)>

The C<qq> form – usually written using double quotes – allows for
interpolation of backslash escape sequences (like C<q:backslash>), all sigiled
variables (like C<q:scalar:array:hash:function>), and any code inside C<{...}>
(like C<q:closure>).

=head3 Interpolating variables

Inside a C<qq>-quoted string, you can use variables with a sigil to trigger
interpolation of the variable's value.  Variables with the C<$> sigil are
interpolated whenever the occur (unless escaped); that's why, in the example
above, C<"$color"> became C<blue>.

Variables with other sigils, however, only trigger interpolation when you follow
the variable with the appropriate postfix (C<[]> for Arrays, C«<>», for Hashes,
C<&> for Subs). This allows you to write expressions like
C<"documentation@raku.org"> without interpolating the C<@raku> variable.

To interpolate an Array (or other L<C<Positional>|/type/Positional> variable),
append a C<[]> to the variable name:

=begin code
my @neighbors = "Felix", "Danielle", "Lucinda";
say "@neighbors[] and I try our best to coexist peacefully."
# OUTPUT: «Felix Danielle Lucinda and I try our best to coexist peacefully.␤»
=end code

Alternatively, rather than using C<[]>, you can interpolate the Array by
following it with a method call with parentheses after the method name. Thus the
following code will work:

=begin code :preamble<my @neighbors = "Felix", "Danielle", "Lucinda">
say "@neighbors.join(', ') and I try our best to coexist peacefully."
# OUTPUT: «Felix, Danielle, Lucinda and I try our best to coexist peacefully.␤»
=end code

However, C<"@example.com"> produces C<@example.com>.

To call a subroutine, use the C<&>-sigil and follow the subroutine name with parentheses.
X<|Syntax,& (interpolation)>

    say "uc  'word'";  # OUTPUT: «uc  'word'»␤
    say "&uc 'word'";  # OUTPUT: «&uc 'word'»␤
    say "&uc('word')"; # OUTPUT: «WORD»␤
    # OUTPUT: «abcDEFghi␤»

To interpolate a Hash (or other L<C<Associative>|/type/Associative> variable), use
the C«<>» postcircumfix operator.

    my %h = :1st; say "abc%h<st>ghi";
    # OUTPUT: «abc1ghi␤»

The way C<qq> interpolates variables is the same as
C<q:scalar:array:hash:function>.  You can use these adverbs (or their short
forms, C<q:s:a:h:f>) to interpolate variables without enabling other C<qq>
interpolations.

=head3 Interpolating closures

Another feature of C<qq> is the ability to interpolate Raku code from
within the string, using curly braces:

=begin code
my ($x, $y, $z) = 4, 3.5, 3;
say "This room is {$x}m by {$y}m by {$z}m.";               # OUTPUT: «This room is 4m by 3.5m by 3m.␤»
say "Therefore its volume should be { $x * $y * $z }m³!";  # OUTPUT: «Therefore its volume should be 42m³!␤»
=end code

This provides the same functionality as the C<q:closure>/C<q:c> quoting form.

=head3 Interpolating escape codes

The C<qq> quoting form also interpolates backslash escape sequences.  Several of
these print invisible/whitespace ASCII control codes or whitespace characters:

=begin table
Sequence    Hex Value       Character            Reference URL
\0          \x0000          Nul                  https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0000
\a          \x0007          Bel                  https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0007
\b          \x0008          Backspace            https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0008
\e          \x001B          Esc                  https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=001B
\f          \x000C          Form Feed            https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=000C
\n          \x000A          Newline              https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=000A
\r          \x000D          Carriage Return      https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=000D
\t          \x0009          Tab                  https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0009
=end table

C<qq> also supports two multi-character escape sequences: C<\x> and C<\c>. You
can use C<\x> or C<\x[]> with the hex-code of a Unicode character or a list of
characters:

    my $s = "I \x2665 Raku!";
    say $s;
    # OUTPUT: «I ♥ Raku!␤»

    $s = "I really \x[2661,2665,2764,1f495] Raku!";
    say $s;
    # OUTPUT: «I really ♡♥❤💕 Raku!␤»

You can also create a Unicode character with C<\c> and that character's
L«unicode name|/language/unicode#Entering_unicode_codepoints_and_codepoint_sequences»
, L<named sequences|/language/unicode#Named_sequences>
or L<name alias|/language/unicode#Name_aliases>:

    my $s = "Camelia \c[BROKEN HEART] my \c[HEAVY BLACK HEART]!";
    say $s;
    # OUTPUT: «Camelia 💔 my ❤!␤»

See the description of
L«\c[]|/language/unicode#Entering_unicode_codepoints_and_codepoint_sequences» on
the L<Unicode|/language/unicode> documentation page for more details.

C<qq> provides the same interpolation of escape sequences as that
provided by C<q:backslash>/C<q:b>.

=head3 preventing interpolation and handling missing values

You can prevent any undesired interpolation in a
C<qq>-quoted string by escaping the sigil or other initial character:

=begin code :preamble<my $color = 'blue'>
say "The \$color variable contains the value '$color'"; # OUTPUT: «The $color variable contains the value 'blue'␤»
=end code

Interpolation of undefined values will raise a control exception that can be
caught in the current block with
L<CONTROL|/language/phasers#CONTROL>.

=begin code
sub niler {Nil};
my Str $a = niler;
say("$a.html", "sometext");
say "alive"; # this line is dead code
CONTROL { .die };
=end code

=head2 Word quoting: qw
X<|Syntax,qw word quote>

=for code :allow<B L>
qw|! @ # $ % ^ & * \| < > | eqv '! @ # $ % ^ & * | < >'.words.list;
q:w { [ ] \{ \} }           eqv ('[', ']', '{', '}');
Q:w | [ ] { } |             eqv ('[', ']', '{', '}');

The C<:w> form, usually written as C<qw>, splits the string into
"words". In this context, words are defined as sequences of non-whitespace
characters separated by whitespace. The C<q:w> and C<qw> forms inherit the
interpolation and escape semantics of the C<q> and single quote string
delimiters, whereas C<Qw> and C<Q:w> inherit the non-escaping semantics of
the C<Q> quoter.

This form is used in preference to using many quotation marks and commas for
lists of strings. For example, where you could write:

    my @directions = 'left', 'right,', 'up', 'down';

It's easier to write and to read this:

    my @directions = qw|left right up down|;

=head2 Word quoting: C«< >»
X«|Syntax,< > word quote»

=for code
say <a b c> eqv ('a', 'b', 'c');   # OUTPUT: «True␤»
say <a b 42> eqv ('a', 'b', '42'); # OUTPUT: «False␤», the 42 became an IntStr allomorph
say < 42 > ~~ Int; # OUTPUT: «True␤»
say < 42 > ~~ Str; # OUTPUT: «True␤»

The angle brackets quoting is like C<qw>, but with extra feature that lets you
construct L<allomorphs|/language/glossary#Allomorph> or literals
of certain numbers:

    say <42 4/2 1e6 1+1i abc>.raku;
    # OUTPUT: «(IntStr.new(42, "42"), RatStr.new(2.0, "4/2"), NumStr.new(1000000e0, "1e6"), ComplexStr.new(<1+1i>, "1+1i"), "abc")␤»

To construct a L«C<Rat>|/type/Rat» or L«C<Complex>|/type/Complex» literal, use
angle brackets around the number, without any extra spaces:

    say <42/10>.^name;   # OUTPUT: «Rat␤»
    say <1+42i>.^name;   # OUTPUT: «Complex␤»
    say < 42/10 >.^name; # OUTPUT: «RatStr␤»
    say < 1+42i >.^name; # OUTPUT: «ComplexStr␤»

Compared to C<42/10> and C<1+42i>, there's no division (or addition) operation
involved. This is useful for literals in routine signatures, for example:

=begin code
sub close-enough-π (<355/113>) {
    say "Your π is close enough!"
}
close-enough-π 710/226; # OUTPUT: «Your π is close enough!␤»
=end code

=begin code :skip-test<illustrates error>
# WRONG: can't do this, since it's a division operation
sub compilation-failure (355/113) {}
=end code

=head2 X<Word quoting with quote protection: qww|Syntax,qww>

The C<qw> form of word quoting will treat quote characters literally, leaving
them in the resulting words:

    say qw{"a b" c}.raku; # OUTPUT: «("\"a", "b\"", "c")␤»

Using the C<qww> variant allows you to use quote characters for embedding strings
in the word quoting structure:

    say qww{"a b" c}.raku; # OUTPUT: «("a b", "c")␤»

Other kinds of quotes are also supported with their usual semantics:

    my $one = 'here';
    my $other = 'there';
    say qww{ ’this and that’ “$one or $other” ｢infinity and beyond｣ }.raku;
    # OUTPUT: «("this and that", "here or there", "infinity and beyond")␤»

The delimiters of embedded strings are always considered word splitters:

    say qww{'alpha'beta'gamma' 'delta'"epsilon"}.raku; # OUTPUT: «("alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta", "epsilon")␤»

=head2 X<Word quoting with interpolation: qqw|Syntax,qqw>

The C<qw> form of word quoting doesn't interpolate variables:

    my $a = 42; say qw{$a b c};  # OUTPUT: «$a b c␤»

Thus, if you wish for variables to be interpolated within the quoted string,
you need to use the C<qqw> variant:

    my $a = 42;
    my @list = qqw{$a b c};
    say @list;                # OUTPUT: «[42 b c]␤»

Note that variable interpolation happens before word splitting:

    my $a = "a b";
    my @list = qqw{$a c};
    .say for @list; # OUTPUT: «a␤b␤c␤»

=head2 X<<<Word quoting with interpolation and quote protection: qqww|Syntax,qqww>>>

The C<qqw> form of word quoting will treat quote characters literally,
leaving them in the resulting words:

    my $a = 42; say qqw{"$a b" c}.raku;  # OUTPUT: «("\"42", "b\"", "c")␤»

Using the C<qqww> variant allows you to use quote characters for embedding strings
in the word quoting structure:

    my $a = 42; say qqww{"$a b" c}.raku; # OUTPUT: «("42 b", "c")␤»

The delimiters of embedded strings are always considered word splitters:

    say qqww{'alpha'beta'gamma' 'delta'"epsilon"}.raku; # OUTPUT: «("alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta", "epsilon")␤»

Unlike the C<qqw> form, interpolation also always splits (except for interpolation that takes place in an embedded string):

    my $time = "now";
    $_ = 'ni';
    my @list = qqww<$time$time {6*7}{7*6} "$_$_">;
    .say for @list; # OUTPUT: «now␤now␤42␤42␤nini␤»

Quote protection happens before interpolation, and interpolation happens
before word splitting, so quotes coming from inside interpolated variables are
just literal quote characters:

    my $a = "1 2";
    say qqww{"$a" $a}.raku; # OUTPUT: «("1 2", "1", "2")␤»
    my $b = "1 \"2 3\"";
    say qqww{"$b" $b}.raku; # OUTPUT: «("1 \"2 3\"", "1", "\"2", "3\"")␤»

=head2 X<<<Word quoting with interpolation and quote protection: « »|Syntax,<< >>;Syntax,« »>>>

This style of quoting is like C<qqww>, but with the added benefit of
constructing L<allomorphs|/language/glossary#Allomorph> (making it
functionally equivalent to L<qq:ww:v|#index-entry-:val_(quoting_adverb)>). The
ASCII equivalent to C<« »> are double angle brackets C«<< >>».

    # Allomorph Construction
    my $a = 42; say «  $a b c    ».raku;  # OUTPUT: «(IntStr.new(42, "42"), "b", "c")␤»
    my $a = 42; say << $a b c   >>.raku;  # OUTPUT: «(IntStr.new(42, "42"), "b", "c")␤»

    # Quote Protection
    my $a = 42; say «  "$a b" c  ».raku;  # OUTPUT: «("42 b", "c")␤»
    my $a = 42; say << "$a b" c >>.raku;  # OUTPUT: «("42 b", "c")␤»

=head2 X<Shell quoting: qx|Syntax,qx>

To run a string as an external program, not only is it possible to pass the
string to the C<shell> or C<run> functions but one can also perform shell
quoting. There are some subtleties to consider, however. C<qx> quotes
I<don't> interpolate variables. Thus

    my $world = "there";
    say qx{echo "hello $world"}

prints simply C<hello>. Nevertheless, if you have declared an environment
variable before calling C<raku>, this will be available within C<qx>, for
instance

=begin code :skip-test<REPL>
WORLD="there" raku
> say qx{echo "hello $WORLD"}
=end code

will now print C<hello there>.

The result of calling C<qx> is returned, so this information can be assigned
to a variable for later use:

    my $output = qx{echo "hello!"};
    say $output;    # OUTPUT: «hello!␤»

See also L<shell|/routine/shell>, L<run|/routine/run> and
L<C<Proc::Async>|/type/Proc::Async> for other ways to execute external commands.

=head2 X<Shell quoting with interpolation: qqx|Syntax,qqx>

If one wishes to use the content of a Raku variable within an external
command, then the C<qqx> shell quoting construct should be used:

    my $world = "there";
    say qqx{echo "hello $world"};  # OUTPUT: «hello there␤»

Again, the output of the external command can be kept in a variable:

    my $word = "cool";
    my $option = "-i";
    my $file = "/usr/share/dict/words";
    my $output = qqx{grep $option $word $file};
    # runs the command: grep -i cool /usr/share/dict/words
    say $output;      # OUTPUT: «Cooley␤Cooley's␤Coolidge␤Coolidge's␤cool␤...»

Be aware of the content of the Raku variable used within an external command; malicious content can be used to execute arbitrary code. See L<C<qqx> traps|/language/traps#Beware_of_variables_used_within_qqx>

See also L<run|/routine/run> and L<C<Proc::Async>|/type/Proc::Async> for
better ways to execute external commands.

=head2 X<Heredocs: :to|Syntax,heredocs :to>

A convenient way to write a multi-line string literal is by using a I<heredoc>, which
lets you choose the delimiter yourself:

=begin code
say q:to/END/;
Here is
some multi-line
string
END
=end code

The contents of the I<heredoc> always begin on the next line, so you can (and
should) finish the line.

=begin code :preamble<sub my-escaping-function { $^x }>
my $escaped = my-escaping-function(q:to/TERMINATOR/, language => 'html');
Here are the contents of the heredoc.
Potentially multiple lines.
TERMINATOR
=end code

If the terminator is indented, that amount of indention is removed from the
string literals. Therefore this I<heredoc>

=begin code
say q:to/END/;
    Here is
    some multi line
        string
    END
=end code

produces this output:

=begin code :lang<text>
Here is
some multi line
    string
=end code

I<Heredocs> include the newline from before the terminator.

To allow interpolation of variables use the C<qq> form, but you will then have
to escape metacharacters C<\{> as well as C<$> if it is not the sigil for a
defined variable. For example:

  my $f = 'db.7.3.8';
  my $s = qq:to/END/;
  option \{
      file "$f";
  };
  END
  say $s;

would produce:

=begin code :lang<text>
option {
    file "db.7.3.8";
};
=end code

Some other situations to pay attention to are innocent-looking ones
where the text looks like a Raku expression. For example, the
following generates an error:

=begin code :lang<text>
my $title = 'USAFA Class of 1965';
say qq:to/HERE/;
<a href='https://usafa-1965.org'>$title</a>
HERE
# Output:
Type Str does not support associative indexing.
  in block <unit> at here.raku line 2
=end code

The angle bracket to the right of '$title' makes it look like a hash index
to Raku when it is actually a L<C<Str>|/type/Str> variable, hence the error message.
One solution is to enclose the scalar with curly braces which is one
way to enter an expression in any interpolating quoting construct:

=begin code :lang<text>
say qq:to/HERE/;
<a href='https://usafa-1965.org'>{$title}</a>
HERE
=end code

Another option is to escape the `<` character to avoid it being parsed
as the beginning of an indexing operator:

=begin code :lang<text>
say qq:to/HERE/;
<a href='https://usafa-1965.org'>$title\</a>
HERE
=end code

Because a I<heredoc> can be very long but is still interpreted by Raku
as a single line, finding the source of an error can sometimes be
difficult. One crude way to debug the error is by starting with the
first visible line in the code and treating is as a I<heredoc> with
that line only. Then, until you get an error, add each line in turn.
(Creating a Raku program to do that is left as an exercise for the
reader.)

You can begin multiple Heredocs in the same line. If you do so, the
second heredoc will not start until after the first heredoc has
ended.

=begin code
my ($first, $second) = qq:to/END1/, qq:to/END2/;
  FIRST
  MULTILINE
  STRING
  END1
   SECOND
   MULTILINE
   STRING
   END2
say $first;  # OUTPUT: «FIRST␤MULTILINE␤STRING␤»
say $second; # OUTPUT: «SECOND␤MULTILINE␤STRING␤»
=end code

Literal strings permit interpolation of embedded quoting constructs by using the
escape sequences such as these:

    my $animal="quaggas";
    say 'These animals look like \qq[$animal]'; # OUTPUT: «These animals look like quaggas␤»
    say 'These animals are \qqw[$animal or zebras]'; # OUTPUT: «These animals are quaggas or zebras␤»

In this example, C<\qq> will do double-quoting interpolation, and C<\qqw> word
quoting with interpolation. Escaping any other quoting construct as above will
act in the same way, allowing interpolation in literal strings.

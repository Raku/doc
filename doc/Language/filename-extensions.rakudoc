=head1 Introduction

An extension is the part of the filename after the final '.'; if no '.'
is present, there is no extension.

Filename extensions can be used to associate behavior with the file content, such as opening
a specialized reader or editor, running a program with the file content as input, etc.
Even when it is not required by the operating system, filename extensions can provide a useful
reminder about the contents of the file.

=head1 History

The Raku language was originally known as PerlÂ 6, and this is reflected in the historic column
above. Please use the current extensions whenever possible when generating new code.

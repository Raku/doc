    class FatRat is Cool does Rational[Int, Int] {}

A C<FatRat> is a rational number stored with arbitrary size numerator and
denominator. Arithmetic operations involving a C<FatRat> and optionally L<Int|/type/Int>
or L<Rat|/type/Rat> objects return a C<FatRat>, avoiding loss of precision.

Since, unlike L<Rat|/type/Rat>, FatRat arithmetics do not fall back L<Num|/type/Num> at some
point, there is a risk that repeated arithmetic operations generate
pathologically large numerators and denominators.

There are two common ways to generate C<FatRat> objects: through the
C<FatRat.new(Int, Int)> constructor, which generates them from numerator and
denominator, or by calling the C<.FatRat> method on an L<Int|/type/Int> or L<Rat|/type/Rat>
object.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method perl

    multi method perl(FatRat:D: --> Str:D)

Returns an implementation-specific string that produces an L<equivalent|/routine/eqv> object
when given to L<EVAL|/routine/EVAL>.

    say FatRat.new(1, 2).perl; # OUTPUT: «FatRat.new(1, 2)␤»

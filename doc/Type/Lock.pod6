=SUBTITLE Low-level thread locking primitive

    class Lock {}

A Lock is a low-level constructor for ensuring that only one thread works with
a certain object at a given time, or runs a piece of code (called the
I<critical section>).

    my $x = 0;
    my $l = Lock.new;
    await (^10).map: {
        start {
            $l.protect({ $x++ });
        }
    }
    say $x;         # OUTPUT: «10␤»

Locks are re-entrant, that is, a thread that holds the lock can lock it again
without blocking.

High-level Perl 6 code should avoid the direct usage of locks, because they
are not composable. Instead, high-level constructs such as
L<Promise|/type/Promise>, L<Channel|/type/Channel> and Supply should be used
whenever possible.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method protect

Defined as:

    method protect(Lock:D: &code)

Runs C<&code> and makes sure it is only run in one thread at once.

Note that the L<Lock> itself needs to be created outside the portion
of the code that gets threaded and it needs to protect. In the first
example below, L<Lock> is first created and assigned to C<$lock>,
which is then used I<inside> the L<Promises|/type/Promise> to protect
the sensitive code. In the second example, a mistake is made, the
C<Lock> is created right inside the L<Promise>, so the code ends up
with a bunch of separate locks, created in a bunch of threads, and
thus they don't actually protect the code we want to protect.

    # Right: $lock is instantiated outside the portion of the
    # code that will get threaded and be in need of protection
    my $lock = Lock.new;
    await ^20 .map: {
        start {
            $lock.protect: {
                print "Foo";
                sleep rand;
                say "Bar";
            }
        }
    }

    # !!! WRONG !!! Lock is created inside threaded area!
    await ^20 .map: {
        start {
            Lock.new.protect: {
                print "Foo"; sleep rand; say "Bar";
            }
        }
    }

=head2 method lock

Defined as:

    method lock(Lock:D:)

Acquires the lock. If it is currently not available, waits for it.

    my $l = Lock.new;
    $l.lock;

=head2 method unlock

Defined as:

    method unlock(Lock:D:)

Releases the lock.

    my $l = Lock.new;
    $l.lock;
    $l.unlock;

=head2 method condition

Defined as:

=begin code :skip-test
my class ConditionVariable {
    method wait();
    method signal();
    method signal_all();
}

method condition(Lock:D: --> ConditionVariable:D)
=end code

Returns a condition variable. Compare

L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_%28synchronization%29> for background.

    my $l = Lock.new;
    $l.condition;

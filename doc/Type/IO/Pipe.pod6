=TITLE class IO::Pipe

=SUBTITLE Buffered inter-process string or binary stream

    class IO::Pipe is IO::Handle {}

An C<IO::Pipe> object closely corresponds to a UNIX pipe. It has one end where
it consumes string or binary data, and another where it reproduces the same
data. It is buffered, so that a write without a read doesn't immediately
block.

Pipes can be easily constructed with L<sub run and Proc::Async.new|/type/Proc:Async>.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method close

Defined as:

    method close(IO::Pipe: --> Proc:D)

Closes the pipe and returns L<Proc> object from which the pipe originates.

=head2 method IO

Defined as:

    method IO(IO::Pipe: --> IO::Path:U)

Returns an L<IO::Path> type object.

=head2 method path

Defined as:

    method path(IO::Pipe: --> IO::Path:U)

Returns an L<IO::Path> type object.

=head2 method proc

Defined as:

    method proc(IO::Pipe: --> Proc:D)

Returns the L<Proc> object from which the pipe originates.

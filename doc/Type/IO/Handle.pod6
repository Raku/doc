=SUBTITLE Opened file or stream

   class IO::Handle { }

=head1 Methods

=head2 method comb

Defined as:

    method comb(IO::Handle:D: Bool :$close, |args --> Seq:D)

Read the handle and processes its contents the same way
L«C<Str.comb>|/type/Str» does, taking the same arguments, closing the handle
when done if C<$close> is set to a true value. Implementations may
slurp the file in its entirety when this method is called.

=head2 routine get

Defined as:

    method get(IO::Handle:D: --> Str:D)
    multi sub get (IO::Handle $fh = $*ARGFILES --> Str:D)

Reads a single line of input from the handle, removing the trailing newline
characters (as set by L«C<.nl-in>|/routine/nl-in»)
if the handle's C<.chomp> attribute is set to C<True>. Returns
C<Nil>, if no more input as available. The subroutine form defaults to
L«C<$*ARGFILES>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AARGFILES» if no handle
is given.

=begin code :skip-test
    $*IN.get.say;              # Read one line from the standard input

    my $fh = open 'filename';
    $fh.get.say;               # Read one line from a file
    $fh.close;

    say get;                   # Read one line from $*ARGFILES
=end code

=head2 method getc

Defined as:

    method getc(IO::Handle:D: --> Str:D)
    multi sub getc (IO::Handle $fh = $*ARGFILES --> Str:D)

Reads a single character from the input stream. The subroutine form defaults
to L«C<$*ARGFILES>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AARGFILES» if no handle
is given. Returns C<Nil>, if no more input as available, otherwise operation
will block, waiting for at least one character to be available; these caveats
apply:

=head3 Buffering terminals

Using getc to get a single keypress from a terminal will only work properly if
you've set the terminal to "unbuffered". Otherwise the terminal will wait for
the return key to be struck or the buffer to be filled up before perl6 gets
even a single byte of data.

=head3 Waiting for potential combiners

If your handle's encoding allows combining characters to be read, perl6 will
wait for more data to be available before it provides a character. This means
that inputting an "e" followed by a combining acute will give you an e with an
acute rather than giving an "e" and letting the next reading function give you
a dangling combiner. However, it also means that when the user inputs just an
"e" and has no intention to also input a combining acute, your program will be
waiting for another keypress before the initial "e" is returned.

=head2 submethod DESTROY

Defined as:

    submethod DESTROY(IO::Handle:D:)

Closes the filehandle. Note that garbage collection is not guaranteed to
happen, so you must NOT rely on C<DESTROY> for closing the handles you
I<write to> and instead close them yourself. Programs that open a lot of files
should close the handles explicitly as well, regardless of whether they were
open for writing, since too many files might get opened before garbage
collection happens and the no longer used handles get closed.

=head method gist

Defined as:

    method gist(IO::Handle:D: --> Str:D)

Returns a string containing information which
L«C<.path>|/type/IO::Handle#method_path», if any, the handle is created for
and whether it is L«C<.opened>|/type/IO::Handle#method_opened».

=begin code :skip-test
    say IO::Handle.new; # IO::Handle<(Any)>(closed)
    say "foo".IO.open;  # IO::Handle<"foo".IO>(opened)
=end code

=head2 method eof

Defined as:

    method eof(IO::Handle:D: --> Bool:D)

Returns C<True> if the read operations have exhausted the contents of the
handle.

=head2 method encoding

Defined as:

    multi method encoding(IO::Handle:D: --> Str:D)
    multi method encoding(IO::Handle:D: Str:D $enc --> Str:D)

Returns a L<Str> representing the encoding currently used by
the handle, defaulting to C<"utf8">. A special value C<"bin"> indicates the
file handle is currently in binary mode. Specifying an optional positional
C<$enc> argument switches the encoding used by the handle.

=begin code :skip-test
    with 'foo'.IO {
        .spurt: "First line is text, then:\nBinary";
        my $fh will leave {.close} = .open;
        $fh.get.say;         # OUTPUT: «First line is text, then:␤»
        $fh.encoding: 'bin';
        $fh.slurp.say;       # OUTPUT: «Buf[uint8]:0x<42 69 6e 61 72 79>␤»
    }
=end code

=head2 routine lines

Defined as:

    sub lines(IO::Handle:D $fh = $*ARGFILES, $limit = Inf, :$close --> Seq:D)
    method lines(IO::Handle:D:               $limit = Inf, :$close --> Seq:D)

Return a L<Seq> each element of which is a line from the handle (that is
chunks delineated by L«C<.nl-in>|/type/IO::Handle#method_nl-in»). If the
handle's L«C<.chomp>|/type/IO::Handle#method_new» attribute is set to C<True>,
then characters specified by L«C<.nl-in>|/type/IO::Handle#method_nl-in» will be
stripped from each line.

Reads up to C<$limit> lines, where C<$limit> can be a non-negative L<Int>,
C<Inf>, or L<Whatever> (which is interpreted to mean C<Inf>). If C<:$close> is
set to C<True>, will close the handle when the file ends or C<$limit> is
reached. Subroutine form defaults to
L«C<$*ARGFILES>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AARGFILES», if no
handle is provided.

B<NOTE:> the lines are read lazily, so ensure the returned L<Seq> is either
L<fully reified|/language/glossary#index-entry-Reify> or is no longer needed
when you close the handle or attempt to use any other methods that change the
file position.

=begin code :skip-test
    say "The file contains ",
      '50GB-file'.IO.open.lines.grep(*.contains: 'Perl').elems,
      " lines that mention Perl";
    # OUTPUT: «The file contains 72 lines that mention Perl␤»
=end code

=head2 method lock

Defined as:

    method lock(IO::Handle:D: Bool:D :$non-blocking = False, Bool:D :$shared = False --> True)

Places an advisory lock on the filehandle. If C<:$non-blocking> is C<True>
will L«C<fail>|/routine/fail» with C<X::IO::Lock> if lock could not be
obtained, otherwise will block until the lock can be placed. If C<:$shared>
is C<True> will place a shared (read) lock, otherwise will place an
exclusive (read) lock. On success, returns C<True>; L«fails|/routine/fail»
with C<X::IO::Lock> if lock cannot be placed (e.g. when trying to place
a shared lock on a filehandle opened in write mode or trying to
place an exclusive lock on a filehandle opened in read mode).

You can use C<lock> again to replace an existing lock with another one.
Use L«C<close>|/routine/close» the filehandle or use
L«C<unlock>|/routine/unlock» to remove a lock.

=for code :skip-test
# One program writes, the other reads, and thanks to locks either
# will wait for the other to finish before proceeding to read/write

# Writer
with "foo".IO.open(:w) {
    .lock;
    .spurt: "I ♥ Perl 6!";
    .close;
}

# Reader
with "foo".IO.open {
    .lock: :shared;
    .slurp.say; # OUTPUT: «I ♥ Perl 6!␤»
    .close;
}

=head2 method unlock

Defined as:

    method unlock(IO::Handle:D: --> True)

Removes a L«C<lock>|/routine/lock» from the filehandle.

=head2 routine words

Defined as:

    multi sub words(IO::Handle:D $fh = $*ARGFILES, $limit = Inf, :$close --> Seq:D)
    multi method words(IO::Handle:D: $limit = Inf, :$close --> Seq:D)

Similar to L«C<Str.words>|/type/Str#routine_words», separates the handle's
stream on contiguous chunks of whitespace (as defined
by Unicode) and returns a L<Seq> of the resultant "words." Takes an optional
C<$limit> argument that can be a non-negative L<Int>, C<Inf>, or L<Whatever>
(which is interpreted to mean C<Inf>), to indicate only up-to C<$limit> words
must be returned. If L<Bool> C<:$close> named argument is set to C<True>,
will automatically close the handle when the returned L<Seq> is exhausted.
Subroutine form defaults to
L«C<$*ARGFILES>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AARGFILES», if no handle
is provided.

=for code :skip-test
my %dict := bag $*IN.words;
say "Most common words: ", %dict.sort(-*.value).head: 5;

B<NOTE:> implementations may read I<more> data than necessary when a call
to C<.words> is made. That is, C<$handle.words(2)> may read more data than two
"words" worth of data and subsequent calls to read methods might not read from
the place right after the two fetched words. After a call to C<.words>, the
file position should be treated as undefined.

=head2 method split

Defined as:

    method split(IO::Handle:D: :$close, |c)

L<Slurps|/routine/slurp> the handle's content and calls
L«C<Str.split>|/type/Str#routine_split» on it, forwarding any of the given
arguments. If C<:$close> named parameter is set to C<True>, will
L<close> the invocant after slurping. It is an error to call this method on
a handle opened in binary mode.

=for code :skip-test
my $fh = 'path/to/file'.IO.open;
$fh.split: '♥', :close; # Returns file content split on ♥

=head2 method spurt

Defined as:

    multi method spurt(IO::Handle:D: Blob $data, :$close = False)
    multi method spurt(IO::Handle:D: Cool $data, :$close = False)

Writes all of the C<$data> into the filehandle, closing it when finished,
if C<$close> is C<True>. For L«C<Cool>|/type/Cool» C<$data>, will use the
encoding the handle is set to use (L«C<IO::Handle.open>|/routine/open»
or L«C<IO::Handle.encoding>|/routine/encoding»).

Behaviour for spurting a L«C<Cool>|/type/Cool» when the handle is in binary
mode or spurting a L«C<Blob>|/type/Blob» when the handle is NOT in binary
mode is undefined.

=head2 method comb

Defined as:

    method comb(IO::Handle:D: :$close, |c)

L<Slurps|/routine/slurp> the handle's content and calls
L«C<Str.split>|/type/Str#routine_comb» on it, forwarding any of the given
arguments. If C<:$close> named parameter is set to C<True>, will
L<close> the invocant after slurping. It is an error to call this method on
a handle opened in binary mode.

=for code :skip-test
my $fh = 'path/to/file'.IO.open;
say "The file has {+$fh.comb: '♥', :close} ♥s in it";

=head2 method print

Defined as:

    method print(**@text --> True)

Writes the given C<@text> to the handle, coercing any non-L<Str> objects
to L<Str> by calling L«C<.Str>|/routine/Str» method on them. See L<write>
to write bytes.

=for code :skip-test
my $fh = 'path/to/file'.IO.open: :w;
$fh.print: 'some text';
$fh.close;

=head2 method print-nl

Defined as:

    method print-nl(IO::Handle:D: --> True)

Writes the value of C<$.nl-out> attribute into the handle.

=for code :skip-test
my $fh = open 'path/to/file', :w, nl-out => "\r\n";
$fh.print("some text");
$fh.print-nl; # prints \r\n
$fh.close;

=head2 method printf

Defined as:

    method printf(IO::Handle:D: Cool $format, *@args)

Formats a string based on the given format and arguments and C<.print>s the
result into the filehandle.
See L<sub sprintf|https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str#sub_sprintf> for details
on acceptable format directives.

=for code :skip-test
my $fh = open 'path/to/file', :w;
$fh.printf: "The value is %d\n", 32;
$fh.close;

=head2 method say

Defined as:

    method say(IO::Handle:D: |)

This method is identical to L<print|/type/IO::Handle#method_print> except
that it stringifies its arguments by calling C<.gist> on them and
auto-appends a newline, with a call to L<print-nl|/type/IO::Handle#method_print-nl>,
after the final argument.

=for code :skip-test
my $fh = open 'path/to/file', :w;
$fh.say(Complex.new(3, 4));        # RESULT: «3+4i\n»
$fh.close;

=head2 method read

Defined as:

    method read(IO::Handle:D: Int(Cool:D) $bytes --> Blob)

Binary reading; reads and returns up to C<$bytes> bytes from the filehandle.

=head2 method readchars

Defined as:

    method readchars(IO::Handle:D: Int(Cool:D) $chars --> Str)

Reading chars; reads and returns up to C<$chars> chars (graphemes) from the
filehandle.

=head2 method write

Defined as:

    method write(IO::Handle:D: Blob:D $buf)

Binary writing; writes C<$buf> to the filehandle.  See L<print> to write
characters.

=head2 method seek

Defined as:

     method seek(IO::Handle:D: Int:D $offset, SeekType:D $whence --> True)

Move the file pointer (that is, the position at which any subsequent read
or write operations will begin) to the byte position specified by
C<$offset> relative to the location specified by C<$whence> which may be
one of:

=item SeekFromBeginning

The beginning of the file.

=item SeekFromCurrent

The current position in the file.

=item SeekFromEnd

The end of the file.  Please note that you need to specify a negative
offset if you want to position before the end of the file.

=head2 method tell

Defined as:

    method tell(IO::Handle:D: --> Int)

Return the current position of the file pointer in bytes.

=head2 method slurp-rest

Defined as:

    multi method slurp-rest(IO::Handle:D: :$bin! --> Buf)
    multi method slurp-rest(IO::Handle:D: :$enc --> Str)

B<DEPRECATION NOTICE:> this method will be deprecated in C<6.d> language. Do
not use it for new code. Use L«C<.slurp> method|/routine/slurp» method
instead.

Return the remaining content of the file from the current file position
(which may have been set by previous reads or by C<seek>.)  If the
adverb C<:bin> is provided a L<Buf> will be returned,
otherwise the return will be a C<Str> with the optional encoding C<:enc>.

=head2 method slurp

Defined as:

    method slurp(IO::Handle:D: :$close = False)

Returns all the content from the current file position to the end.
If the invocant is in binary mode, will return L<Buf>, otherwise will decode
the content using invocant's current L«C<.encoding>|/routine/encoding» and
return a L<Str>.

If C<:$close> is set to C<True>, will close the handle when finished reading.

=head2 method Supply

Defined as:

    multi method Supply(IO::Handle:D: :$size = 65536)

Returns a C<Supply> that will emit the contents of the handle in chunks.
The chunks will be L«C<Buf>|/type/Buf» if the handle is in binary mode
or, if it isn't, L«C<Str>|/type/Str» decoded using same encoding as L«C<IO::Handle.encoding>|/routine/encoding».

The size of the chunks is determined by the optional C<:size> named
parameter and C<65536> bytes in binary mode or C<65536> characters in non-binary
mode.

=for code :skip-test
    "foo".IO.open(:bin).Supply(:size<10>).tap: *.perl.say;
    # OUTPUT:
    # Buf[uint8].new(73,32,226,153,165,32,80,101,114,108)
    # Buf[uint8].new(32,54,33,10)

    "foo".IO.open.Supply(:size<10>).tap: *.perl.say;
    # OUTPUT:
    # "I ♥ Perl 6"
    # "!\n"


=head2 method path

Defined as:

    method path(IO::Handle:D:)

For a handle opened on a file this returns the L<IO::Path> that
represents the file. For the standard I/O handles
L«C<$*IN>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AIN»,
L«C<$*OUT>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AOUT», and
L«C<$*ERR>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AERR» it returns an
L<IO::Special> object.

=head2 method IO

Defined as:

    method IO(IO::Handle:D:)

Alias for L«C<.path>|/type/IO::Handle#method_path»

=head2 method Str

Returns the value of L«C<.path>|/type/IO::Handle#method_path», coerced
to L<Str>.

=for code :skip-test
    say "foo".IO.open.path; # OUTPUT: «"foo".IO␤»

=head2 method close

Defined as:

    method close(IO::Handle:D: --> Bool:D)
    multi sub close(IO::Handle $fh)

Closes an open file handle. It's not an error to call C<close> on an
already-closed filehandle. Returns C<True> on success.

It's a common idiom to use L«C<LEAVE> phaser|/language/phasers#LEAVE» for
closing the handles, which ensures the handle is closed regardless of how the
block is left.

=begin code :skip-test
    if $do-stuff-with-the-file {
        my $fh = open "path-to-file";
        LEAVE close $fh;
        # ... do stuff with the file
    }

    sub do-stuff-with-the-file (IO $path-to-file)
      my $fh = $path-to-file.open;

      # stick a `try` on it, since this will get run even when the sub is
      # called with wrong arguments, in which case the `$fh` will be an `Any`
      LEAVE try close $fh;

      # ... do stuff with the file
    }

    with "foo/bar".IO.open(:w) {
        .spurt: "I ♥ Perl 6!";
        .close;
    }
=end code

B<Note:> unlike some other languages, Perl 6 does not use reference counting,
and so B<the file handles are NOT closed when they go out of scope>. While
they I<will> get closed when garbage collected, garbage collection isn't
guaranteed to get run. This means B<you must> use an explicit C<close> on
handles opened for writing, to avoid data loss, and an explicit C<close>
is I<recommended> on handles opened for reading as well, so that your program
does not open too many files at the same time, triggering exceptions on further
C<open> calls.

As a simpler alternative, the L<IO::Path> type provides many reading and
writing methods that let you work with files without dealing with file handles
directly.

=head2 method flush

Defined as:

    method flush(IO::Handle:D: --> True)

Will flush the handle, writing any of the buffered data. Returns C<True>
on success; otherwise, L<fails|/routine/fail> with C<X::IO::Flush>.

=begin code :skip-test
    with "foo".IO.open: :w {
        LEAVE .close;
        $fh.print: 'something';
        'foo'.IO.slurp.say; # (if the data got buffered) OUTPUT: «␤»
        $fh.flush;          # flush the handle
        'foo'.IO.slurp.say; # OUTPUT: «something␤»
    }
=end code

=head2 method native-descriptor

Defined as:

    method native-descriptor()

This returns a value that the operating system would understand as a "file descriptor" and
is suitable for passing to a native function that requires a file descriptor as an
argument such as C<fcntl> or C<ioctl>.

=head2 method nl-in

Defined as:

    method nl-in(--> Proxy:D) is rw

One of the attributes that can be set via C<.new>.
Defaults to C<["\x0A", "\r\n"]>
Takes either a L<Str> or L<Array> of C<Str> specifying line ending(s) for this
handle. If C<.chomp> attribute is set to C<True>, will strip these endings
in routines that C<chomp>, such as L«C<get>|/routine/get» and
L«C<lines>|/routine/lines».

=begin code :skip-test
    with 'test'.IO {
        .spurt: '1foo2bar3foo'; # write some data into our test file
        my $fh will leave {.close} = .open; # can also set .nl-in via .open arg
        $fh.nl-in = [<foo bar>]; # set two possible line endings to use;
        $fh.lines.say; # OUTPUT: ("1", "2", "3").Seq
    }
=end code

=head2 method opened

Defined as:

    method opened(IO::Handle:D: --> Bool:D)

Returns C<True> if the handle is open, C<False> otherwise.

=head2 method t

Defined as:

    method t(IO::Handle:D: --> Bool:D)

Returns C<True> if the handle is opened to a
L<TTY|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator>, C<False> otherwise.

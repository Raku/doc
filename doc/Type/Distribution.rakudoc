=SUBTITLE Distribution

    role Distribution { }

This role is an interface for objects that provide API access mapping META6 data
to the files it represents. Objects that fulfill the C<Distribution> role can be
read by e.g.
L<CompUnit::Repository::Installation|/type/CompUnit::Repository::Installation>.
Generally a C<Distribution> provides read access to a set of modules and
metadata. These may be backed by the filesystem
(L<Distribution::Path|/type/Distribution::Path>,
L<Distribution::Hash|/type/Distribution::Hash>) but could also read from an e.g.
tar file or socket.

=head1 Required Methods

=head2 method meta

    method meta(--> Hash:D) { ... }

Returns a Hash with the representation of the metadata. Please note that an
actual C<META6.json> file does not need to exist, just a representation in that
format.

=head2 method content

    method content($name-path --> IO::Handle:D) { ... }

Returns an C<IO::Handle> to the file represented by C<$name-path>. C<$name-path>
is a relative path as it would be found in the metadata such as C<lib/Foo.rakumod>
or C<resources/foo.txt>.

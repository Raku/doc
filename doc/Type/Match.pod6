=TITLE class Match

=SUBTITLE Result of a successful regex match

    class Match is Capture is Cool {}

C<Match> objects are the result of a successful regex match, this does include
any zero-width match. They store a reference to the original string (C<.orig>),
positional and named captures, the positions of the start and end of the match
in the original string, and a payload referred to as I<AST> (abstract syntax
tree), which can be used to build data structures from complex regexes and
grammars.

Submatches are also C<Match> objects (or lists of C<Match> objects,
if the corresponding regex was quantified), so each match object
can be seen as the root of a tree of match objects.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method orig

Returns the original string that the regex was matched against.

=head2 method from

Returns the index of the starting position of the match.

=head2 method to

Returns the index of the end position of the match.

=head2 method made

Returns the payload that was set with L<#method make>.

=head2 method actions

    method actions(Match:D: --> Mu)

Returns the actions object (if any was set; else L<Mu>) that the grammar used
from which this Match object was created.

=head2 method ast

Alias for L<#method made>.

=head2 method Bool

Defined as:

    method Bool(Capture:D: --> Bool:D)

Returns C<True> on successful and C<False> on unsuccessful matches. Please note
that any zero-width match can also be successful.

    say 'abc' ~~ /^/;                   # OUTPUT: «｢｣␤»
    say $/.from, ' ',  $/.to, ' ', ?$/; # OUTPUT: «0 0 True␤»

=head2 method Str

Defined as:

    method Str(Match:D: --> Str:D)

Returns the matched text.

    "abc123def" ~~ /\d+/;
    say $/.Str;               # OUTPUT: «123␤»

=head2 method caps

Returns a list of pairs, with the index or submatch name as key and
the submatches as values. The list is ordered by starting position
of the submatches.

=head2 method chunks

Returns a list of pairs, with the index or submatch name as key and
the submatches as values. The list is ordered by starting position
of the submatches.

Those parts of the string that were not matched by submatches are
interleaved with the other pairs, with the string C<~> as key.

=head2 method list

Returns a list of positional submatches.

=head2 method hash

Returns a hash of named submatches.

=head2 method prematch

Defined as:

    method prematch(Match:D: --> Str:D)

Returns the part of the original string leading up to the match.

    'abcdefg' ~~ /cd/;
    say $/.prematch;          # OUTPUT: «ab␤»

    # will return a list of three match objects
    "abc123def" ~~ m:g/\d/;
    say $/.[1].prematch;      # OUTPUT: «abc1␤»

=head2 method postmatch

Defined as:

    method postmatch(Match:D: --> Str:D)

Returns the part of the original string following the match.

    'abcdefg' ~~ /cd/;
    say $/.postmatch;         # OUTPUT: «efg␤»

    # will return a list of three match objects
    "abc123def" ~~ m:g/\d/;
    say $/.[1].postmatch;     # OUTPUT: «3def␤»

=head2 method make

    method make(Match:D: Mu $payload)
    sub make(Mu $payload)

Stores an arbitrary payload into the C<Match> object that can later be retrieved
via L«C<.made>|/routine/made» method.

This is typically used in a L<grammar|/language/grammars>'s actions class
methods, where a piece of data is stored by one method and then later retrieved
by another. It's up to you what data you store. It could be a tree node, L<result
of a calculation|/language/grammars#Protoregexes>, or a list of values.

The sub form operates on the current C<$/>, which can be a convenient shortcut:

    method my-action ($/) {
        make "foo: $/";
    }

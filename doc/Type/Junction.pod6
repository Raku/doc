=TITLE class Junction

=SUBTITLE Logical superposition of values

    class Junction is Mu { }

A junction is an unordered composite value of zero or more values. Junctions
I<autothread> over many operations, which means that the operation
is carried out for each junction element (also known as I<eigenstate>), and
the result is junction of the return values of all those operators.

Junctions collapse into a single value in boolean context, so when used in a
conditional, a negation or an explicit coercion to Bool through the C<so> or
C<?> prefix operators. The semantics of this collapse
depend on the I<junction type>, which can be C<all>, C<any>, C<one> or
C<none>.

=begin table

    type |   constructor  |   operator |  True if ...
    =====+================+============+===========
    all  |   all          |   &        |   no value evaluates to False
    any  |   any          |   \|       |   at least one value evaluates to True
    one  |   one          |   ^        |   exactly one value evaluates to True
    none |   none         |            |   no value evaluates to True

=end table

Autothreading happens when a junction is bound to a parameter of a code object
that doesn't accept values of type C<Junction>. Instead of producing an error,
the signature binding is repeated for each value of the junction.

Example:

    my $j = 1|2;
    if 3 == $j + 1 {
        say 'yes';
    }

First autothreads over the C<< infix:<+> >> operator, producing the Junction
C<2|3>. The next autothreading step is over C<< infix:<==> >>, which produces
C<False|True>. The C<if> conditional evaluates the junction in boolean
context, which collapses it to C<True>. So the code prints C<yes\n>.

The type of a C<Junction> does I<not> affect the number of items in the
resultant C<Junction> after autothreading. For example, using a L<one|/routine/one>
C<Junction> during L<Hash|/type/Hash> key lookup, still results in a C<Junction>
with several items. It is only in boolean context would the type of the
C<Junction> come into play:

    my %h = :42foo, :70bar;
    say    %h{one <foo meow>}:exists; # OUTPUT: «one(True, False)␤»
    say so %h{one <foo meow>}:exists; # OUTPUT: «True␤»
    say    %h{one <foo  bar>}:exists; # OUTPUT: «one(True, True)␤»
    say so %h{one <foo  bar>}:exists; # OUTPUT: «False␤»

Note that the compiler is allowed, but not required, to parallelize
autothreading (and Junction behavior in general), so it is usually an
error to autothread junctions over code with side effects.

Implementations are allowed to short-circuit Junctions. For example one or more
routine calls (C<a()>, C<b()>, or C<c()>) in the code below might not get
executed at all, if the result of the conditional has been fully determined
from routine calls already performed (only one truthy return value is enough
to know the entire Junction is true):

=begin code :preamble<sub a(){}; sub b(){}; sub c(){}>
if a() | b() | c() {
    say "At least one of the routines was called and returned a truthy value"
}
=end code

Junctions are meant to be used as matchers in boolean context; introspection
of junctions is not supported. If you feel the urge to introspect a junction,
use a L<Set|/type/Set> or a related type instead.

Usage examples:

    my @list = <1 2 "Great">;
    @list.append(True).append(False);
    my @bool_or_int = grep Bool|Int, @list;

    sub is_prime(Int $x) returns Bool {
        # 'so' is for boolean context
        so $x %% none(2..$x.sqrt);
    }
    my @primes_ending_in_1 = grep &is_prime & / 1$ /, 2..100;
    say @primes_ending_in_1;        # OUTPUT: «[11 31 41 61 71]␤»

    my @exclude = <~ .git>;
    for dir(".") { say .Str if .Str.ends-with(none @exclude) }

Special care should be taken when using C<all> with arguments that may
produce an empty list:

    my @a = ();
    say so all(@a) # True, because there are 0 False's

To express "all, but at least one", you can use C<@a && all(@a)>

    my @a = ();
    say so @a && all(@a);   # OUTPUT: «False␤»

Negated operators are special-cased when it comes to autothreading.
C<$a !op $b> is rewritten internally as C<!($a op $b)>. The outer
negation collapses any junctions, so the return value always a plain
L<Bool|/type/Bool>.

    my $word = 'yes';
    my @negations = <no none never>;
    if $word !eq any @negations {
        say '"yes" is not a negation';
    }

Note that without this special-casing, an expression like
C<$word ne any @words> would always evaluate to C<True> for non-trivial lists
on one side.

For this purpose, C<< infix:<ne> >> counts as a negation of C<< infix:<eq> >>.

In general it is more readable to use a positive comparison operator and
a negated junction:

    my $word = 'yes';
    my @negations = <no none never>;
    if $word eq none @negations {
        say '"yes" is not a negation';
    }


=head1 Failures and Exceptions

L<Failures|/type/Failure> are just values like any other, as far as Junctions
are concerned:

    my $j = +any "not a number", "42", "2.1";
    (gather $j».take).grep(Numeric).say; # OUTPUT: «(42 2.1)␤»

Above, we've used prefix C<+> operator on a L<Junction|/type/Junction> to coerce the strings
inside of it to L<Numeric|/type/Numeric>. Since the operator returns a L<Failure|/type/Failure> when
L<Str|/type/Str> that doesn't contain a number gets coerced to C<Numeric>, one of the
elements in the C<Junction> is a C<Failure>, but same C<Failure> rules as normal
apply and the C<Failure> doesn't explode just because it's in a C<Junction>, and
we can L«C<.grep>|/routine/grep» it out. The exception I<will> be thrown,
if you try to use the C<Failure> as a value—just like were this C<Failure> on
its own and not part of the C<Junction>:

    my $j = +any "not a number", "42", "2.1";
    try say $j == 42;
    $! and say "Got exception: $!.^name()"; # OUTPUT: «Got exception: X::Str::Numeric␤»

Note that if an exception gets thrown when I<any> of the values in a
L<Junction|/type/Junction> get computed, it will be thrown just as if the problematic value
were computed on its own and not with a C<Junction>; you can't just compute the
values that work while ignoring exceptions:

    sub calc ($_) { die when 13 }
    my $j = any 1..42;
    say try calc $j; # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

Only one value above causes an exception, but the result of the
L«C<try> block|/language/exceptions#index-entry-try_blocks-try» is still a L<Nil|/type/Nil>.
A possible way around it is to cheat and evaluate the values of the C<Junction>
individually and then re-create the C<Junction> from the result:

    sub calc ($_) { die when 13 }
    my $j = any 1..42;
    $j = any (gather $j».take).grep: {Nil !=== try calc $_};
    say so $j == 42; # OUTPUT: «True␤»

=head1 Smartmatching

Note that using Junctions on the right-hand side of C<~~> works
slightly differently than using Junctions with other operators.

Consider this example:

    say 25 == (25 | 42);    # OUTPUT: «any(True, False)␤» – Junction
    say 25 ~~ (25 | 42);    # OUTPUT: «True␤»             – Bool

The reason is that C<==> (and most other operators) are subject to
auto-threading, and therefore you will get a Junction as a result. On
the other hand, C<~~> will call C<.ACCEPTS> on the right-hand-side (in
this case on a Junction) and the result will be a C<Bool>.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method Str

Defined as:

    multi method Str(Junction:D:)

Autothreads the C<.Str> method over its elements and returns results as a L<Junction|/type/Junction>. Output
methods that use C<.Str> method (L<print|/routine/print> and L<put|/routine/put>) are special-cased to autothread junctions,
despite being able to accept a L<Mu|/type/Mu> type.

=head2 method gist

Defined as:

    multi method gist(Junction:D:)

Collapses the L<Junction|/type/Junction> and returns a L<Str|/type/Str> composed of the type of the junction and the
L<gists|/routine/gist> of its components:

    <a 42 c>.all.say; # OUTPUT: «all(a, 42, c)␤»

=head2 method perl

Defined as:

    multi method perl(Junction:D:)

Collapses the L<Junction|/type/Junction> and returns a L<Str|/type/Str> composed of L<perls|/routine/perl> of its components
that L<evaluates|/routine/EVAL> to the equivalent L<Junction|/type/Junction> with equivalent components:

    <a 42 c>.all.perl.put; # OUTPUT: «all("a", IntStr.new(42, "42"), "c")␤»

=head2 infix C<~>

Defined as:

    multi sub infix:<~>(Str:D $a, Junction:D $b)
    multi sub infix:<~>(Junction:D $a, Str:D $b)
    multi sub infix:<~>(Junction:D \a, Junction:D \b)

The infix C<~> concatenation can be used to merge junctions into a single one or merge Junctions with strings.
The resulting junction will have all elements merged as if they were
joined into a nested loop:

=begin code
my $odd  = 1|3|5;
my $even = 2|4|6;

my $merged = $odd ~ $even;
say $merged; #OUTPUT: «any(12, 14, 16, 32, 34, 36, 52, 54, 56)␤»

say "Found 34!" if 34 == $merged; #OUTPUT: «Found 34!␤»
my $prefixed = "0" ~ $odd;
say "Found 03" if "03" == $prefixed; #OUTPUT: «Found 03!␤»

my $postfixed = $odd ~ "1";
say "Found 11" if 11 == $postfixed; #OUTPUT: «Found 11!␤»
=end code

On the other hand, the versions of C<~> that use a string as one argument will just concatenate the string to every member of the Junction, creating another Junction with the same number of elements.

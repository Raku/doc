=TITLE role Positional

=SUBTITLE Object that supports looking up values by index

    role Positional { ... }

Role for objects which support indexing them using C<postcircumfix:«[ ]»>
(usually list-like objects).  Example types with Positional role
include L<List|/type/List>, L<Array|/type/Array>, L<Range|/type/Range>, and L<Buf|/type/Buf>.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method of

    method of()

Returns the type constraint for elements of the positional container. Defaults
to L<Mu|/type/Mu>.

=head1 Methods that should be provided

=head2 method elems

    method elems()

Should return the number of available elements in the instantiated object.

=head2 method AT-POS

    method AT-POS(\position)

Should return the value / container at the given position.

=head2 method EXISTS-POS

    method EXISTS-POS(\position)

Should return a C<Bool> indicating whether the given position actually has a
value.

=head2 method STORE

    method STORE(\values, :$INITIALIZE)

This method should only be supplied if you want to support the:

=for code :preamble<role Foo {}>
my @a is Foo = 1,2,3;

syntax for binding your implementation of the C<Positional> role.

Should accept the values to (re-)initialize the object with.  The optional
named parameter will contain a C<True> value when the method is called on
the object for the first time.  Should return the invocant.

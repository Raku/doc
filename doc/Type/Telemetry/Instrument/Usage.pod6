=SUBTITLE Instrument for collecting getrusage data

    class Telemetry::Instrument::Usage { }

B<Note: > This class is a Rakudo-specific feature and not standard PerlÂ 6.

Objects of this class are generally not created by themselves, but rather
through making a L<snap|/type/Telemetry>shot.

=head2 Useful readings

This class provides the following generally usable readings (in alphabetical
order):

=item cpu

The total amount of CPU time (in microseconds), essentially the sum of
C<cpu-user> and C<cpu-sys>.

=item cpu-sys

The number of microseconds of CPU used by the system.

=item cpu-user

The number of microseconds of CPU used by the user program.

=item cpus

The number of CPU's active, essentially C<cpu> divided by C<wallclock>.

=item max-rss

The maximum resident set size (in KiB).

=item util%

Percentage of CPU utilization, essentially 100 * C<cpus> / number of CPU cores.

=item wallclock

The time the program has been executing (in microseconds).

=head Less useful readings

The following readings may or may not contain sensible information, mostly
depending on hardware and OS being used.  Please check your local C<getrusage>
documentation for their exact meaning:

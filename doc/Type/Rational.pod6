=TITLE role Rational

=SUBTITLE Number stored as numerator and denominator

    role Rational[::NuT, ::DeT] does Real { ... }

C<Rational> is the common role for numbers that are stored as pairs of numerator
and denominator. It is parameterized by the types of the numerator (C<NuT>) and
denominator (C<DeT>). By default, these are C<Int>, but other types of
C<Rational> are possible by using a different parameterization

    class Positive does Rational[UInt] {};
    my Positive $one-third = Positive.new(1,3);
    say $one-third;                         # OUTPUT: «0.333333␤»
    my Positive $fail =Positive.new(-2,3);  # OUTPUT: «Type check failed in binding to parameter 'nu'; expected UInt but got Int (-2)␤»

Please note that, since C<DeT> is by default equal to C<NuT>, in this case both
are instantiated to C<UInt>. Built into Perl 6 are L<Rat|/type/Rat> and L<FatRat|/type/FatRat>, which
both do the C<Rational> role.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method new

=for code :skip-test<compile time error>
method new(NuT:D: $numerator, DeT:D: $denominator --> Rational:D)

Creates a new rational object from numerator and denominator, which it
normalizes to the lowest terms. The C<$denominator> can be zero, in which
case the numerator is normalized to C<-1>, C<0>, or C<1> depending on whether
the original is negative, zero, or positive, respectively.

=head2 method Bool

Defined as:

    multi method Bool(Rational:D: --> Bool:D)

Returns C<False> if L<numerator|/routine/numerator> is C<0>, otherwise returns C<True>. This
applies for C«<0/0>» zero-denominator L<Rational|/type/Rational> as well, despite C«?<0/0>.Num»
being C<True>.

=head2 method Int

Defined as:

    method Int(Rational:D: --> Int:D)

Coerces the invocant to L<Int|/type/Int> by truncating non-whole portion of the represented
number, if any. If the L<denominator|/routine/denominator> is zero, will L<fail|/routine/fail> with
C<X::Numeric::DivideByZero>.

=head2 method Num

Defined as:

    method Num(Rational:D: --> Num:D)

Coerces the invocant to L<Num|/type/Num> by dividing L<numerator|/routine/numerator> by L<denominator|/routine/denominator>.
If L<denominator|/routine/denominator> is C<0>, returns C<Inf>, C<-Inf>, or C<NaN>, based on
whether L<numerator|/routine/numerator> is a positive number, negative number, or C<0>,
respectively.

=head2 method ceiling

Defined as:

    method ceiling(Rational:D: --> Int:D)

Return the smallest integer not greater than the invocant. If L<denominator|/routine/denominator>
is zero, L<fails|/routine/fail> with C<X::Numeric::DivideByZero>.

=head2 method floor

Defined as:

    method floor(Rational:D: --> Int:D)

Return the largest integer not greater than the invocant. If L<denominator|/routine/denominator>
is zero, L<fails|/routine/fail> with C<X::Numeric::DivideByZero>.

=head2 method isNaN

=for code
method isNaN(Rational:D: --> Bool:D)

Tests whether the invocant's Num value is a NaN, an acronym for I<Not available
Number>. That is both its numerator and denominator are zero.

=head2 method numerator

=for code :skip-test
method numerator(Rational:D: --> NuT:D)

Returns the numerator.

=head2 method denominator

=for code :skip-test
method denominator(Rational:D: --> DeT:D)

Returns the denominator.

=head2 method nude

    method nude(Rational:D: --> Positional)

Returns a list of the numerator and denominator.

=head2 method norm

    method norm(Rational:D: --> Rational:D)

B<DEPRECATED as of 6.d>. The method is no longer needed, because as of 6.d
language version, it's required for C<Rational> type to be normalized on
creation.

Returns a normalized Rational object, i.e. with positive denominator, and
numerator and denominator coprime. The denominator can also by zero, but using
it in any operation or a conversion to string will result in an exception.

=for code :solo
use v6.c;
my Rational $by-zero = 3/0;
say $by-zero.norm.perl; # OUTPUT: «<1/0>␤»

=for code :skip-test<Illustrates exception>
say $by-zero; # OUTPUT: «Attempt to divide by zero when coercing Rational to Str␤

=head2 method base-repeating

    method base-repeating(Rational:D: Int:D() $base = 10)

Returns a list of two strings that, when concatenated, represent the number in
base C<$base>. The second element is the one that repeats. For example:

    my ($non-rep, $repeating) = (19/3).base-repeating(10);
    say $non-rep;                               # OUTPUT: «6.␤»
    say $repeating;                             # OUTPUT: «3␤»
    printf '%s(%s)', $non-rep, $repeating;      # OUTPUT: «6.(3)»

19/3 is 6.333333... with the 3 repeating indefinitely.

If no repetition occurs, the second string is empty:

    say (5/2).base-repeating(10).perl;          # OUTPUT: «("2.5", "")␤»

The precision for determining the repeating group is limited to 1000
characters, above that, the second string is C<???>.

C<$base> defaults to C<10>.

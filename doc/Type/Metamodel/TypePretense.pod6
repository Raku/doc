=SUBTITLE Metarole for type pretenses

    role Metamodel::TypePretense { }

I<Warning>: this role is part of the Rakudo implementation, and is not
a part of the language specification.

Roles can type-check as C<Mu>, C<Any>, and C<Cool>, but don't actually
have these classes as parents:

=begin code
class Class { }
role  Role  { }

say Role ~~ Mu;   # OUTPUT: «True␤»
say Role ~~ Any;  # OUTPUT: «True␤»
say Role ~~ Cool; # OUTPUT: «True␤»

say Class.^parents(:all).map(*.^name);     # OUTPUT: «(Any Mu)␤»
say Role.^pun.^parents(:all).map(*.^name); # OUTPUT: «()␤»
=end code

C<Metamodel::TypePretense> is the metarole that's responsible for this
behavior. Using the metamethods this provides, types can C<pretend to
be> other types, i.e. types can type-check as other types. This can be
useful when implementing types that should not store parent types
through
L<C<Metamodel::MultipleInheritance>|/type/Metamodel::MultipleInheritance>,
but should still type-check like other types somehow.

All this metarole does is provide an interface for storing type objects
in a HOW and provide a default C<type_check> method that allows types to
type-check as the types they're pretending to be if no other
type-checking behavior for it exists; any other behavior related to type
pretenses are left up to the metaclasses that do this metarole to
implement themselves.

Because type pretenses are a property of the metaclass for a HOW, not
HOWs themselves, the C<pretend_to_be> and C<pretending_to_be>
metamethods this metarole provides must be invoked directly through a
metaclass or HOW, not with C<.^> syntax:

=for code :preamble<role Role { }>
say Role.HOW.pretending_to_be.map(*.^name); # OUTPUT: «(Cool Any Mu)»

This metarole is commonly used in combination with
L<C<Metamodel::MethodDelegation>|/type/Metamodel::MethodDelegation>.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method pretend_to_be

    method pretend_to_be(@types)

Makes all types for a type of HOW pretend to be any of the type objects
in C<@types>.

=head2 method pretending_to_be

    method pretending_to_be()

Returns the type objects this type of HOW is pretending to be.

=head2 method type_check

    method type_check($obj, $checkee)

If C<$checkee> is the same object as C<$obj> or is of any of the types
C<$obj> is pretending to be, returns C<1>, otherwise returns C<0>.

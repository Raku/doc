=TITLE role Metamodel::MultipleInheritance

=SUBTITLE Metaobject that supports multiple inheritance

    role Metamodel::MultipleInheritance {}

I<Warning>: this role is part of the Rakudo implementation, and is not
a part of the language specification.

Classes, roles and grammars can have parent classes, that is, classes to which
method lookups fall back to, and to whose type the child class conforms to.

This role implements the capability of having zero, one or more parent (or
I<super>) classes.

In addition, it supports the notion of I<hidden> classes, whose methods are
excluded from the normal dispatching chain, so that for example C<nextsame>
ignores it.

This can come in two flavors: methods from a class marked as C<is hidden>
are generally excluded from dispatching chains, and C<class A hides B> adds
C<B> as a parent class to C<A>, but hides it from the method resolution order,
so that L<mro_unhidden|/type/Metamodel::C3MRO#method_mro_unhidden> skips it.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method add_parent

    method add_parent($obj, $parent, :$hides)

Adds C<$parent> as a parent type. If C<$hides> is set to a true value, the
parent type is added as a hidden parent.

C<$parent> must be a fully
L<composed|/language/mop#Composition_time_and_static_reasoning> typed.
Otherwise an exception of type L<C<X::Inheritance::NotComposed>|/type/X::Inheritance::NotComposed>
is thrown.

=head2 method ^parents

    method ^parents($obj, :$all, :$tree)

Returns the list of parent classes. By default it stops at L<C<Cool>|/type/Cool>, L<C<Any>|/type/Any> or
L<C<Mu>|/type/Mu>, which you can suppress by supplying the C<:all> adverb. With C<:tree>,
a nested list is returned.

    class D { };
    class C1 is D { };
    class C2 is D { };
    class B is C1 is C2 { };
    class A is B { };

    say A.^parents(:all).raku;
    # OUTPUT: «(B, C1, C2, D, Any, Mu)␤»
    say A.^parents(:all, :tree).raku;
    # OUTPUT: «[B, ([C1, [D, [Any, [Mu]]]], [C2, [D, [Any, [Mu]]]])]␤»

=head2 method hides

    method hides($obj)

Returns a list of all hidden parent classes.

=head2 method hidden

    method hidden($obj)

Returns a true value if (and only if) the class is marked with the trait C<is
hidden>.

=head2 method set_hidden

    method set_hidden($obj)

Marks the type as hidden.

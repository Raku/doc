=TITLE module snapper

=SUBTITLE Start a thread taking repeated system state snapshots

This module contains no subroutines or methods or anything.  It is intended
as a shortcut for starting the L<snapper> subroutine of the L<Telemetry>
module, allowing taking snapshots of the execution of a program without needing
to change the program.  Simple loading the module with C<-Msnapper> will do
all that is needed to start the snapper, and have a report printed on STDERR
upon completion of the program.

The C<RAKUDO_SNAPPER> environment variable can be set to indicate the time
between snapshots.  If not specified, it will default to B<0.1> seconds.

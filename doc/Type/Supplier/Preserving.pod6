=TITLE class Supplier::Preserving

=SUBTITLE Cached live Supply factory

    class Supplier::Preserving is Supplier { }

This is a factory for live L<Supply|/type/Supply> objects, which
provides the mechanism for emitting new values onto the supplies, whereby
values are kept when no consumer has tapped into the C<Supply>. Any tapping
will consume the already stored and future values.

Starting a preserving C<Supply> and consuming its values after it is C<done>:

    my $p = Supplier::Preserving.new;
    start for ^3 {
        $p.emit($_);
        LAST {
            say „done after { now - BEGIN now}s“;
            $p.done;
        }
    }
    sleep 2;
    react {
        whenever $p.Supply { $_.say; }
        whenever Promise.in(2) { done }
    }
    say „also done after { now - BEGIN now }s“

Will output:

also done after 4.0534119s

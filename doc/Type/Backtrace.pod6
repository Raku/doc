=TITLE class Backtrace

=SUBTITLE Snapshot of the dynamic call stack

    class Backtrace is List { ... }

A backtrace shows the dynamic call stack, usually leading up to a point
where an exception was thrown.

It is a List of L<Backtrace::Frame> objects.  Its default stringification
excludes backtrace frames that are deemed unnecessary or confusing, for
example routines like C<&die> are hidden by default.

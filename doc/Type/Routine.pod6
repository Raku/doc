=TITLE class Routine

=SUBTITLE Code object with its own lexical scope and C<return> handling

    class Routine is Block { }

A C<Routine> is a code object meant for larger unities of code than L<Block>.
Routine is the common superclass for L<Sub> (and therefore operators) and
L<Method>, the two primary code objects for code reuse.

Routines serve as a scope limiter for C<return> (i.e. a C<return> returns
from the innermost outer Routine).

Routine is also the level at which
L<multiness|/language/glossary#Multi-Dispatch> (multi subs and multi methods)
are handled.

X<|is default (Routine)>
=head2 X<Trait is default>

There is a special trait for C<Routine>s called C<is default>. This trait is
designed as a way to disambiguate C<multi> calls that would normally
throw an error because the compiler would not know which one to use. This means that
given the following two C<Routine>s, the one with the C<is default> trait will be
called.

    multi sub f() is default { say "Hello there" }
    multi sub f() { say "Hello friend" }
    f();   # OUTPUT: «"Hello there"␤»

The C<is default> trait can become very useful for debugging and other uses but
keep in mind that it will only resolve an ambiguous dispatch between two
C<Routine>s of the same precedence. If one of the C<Routine>s are narrower than
another, then that one will be called. For example:

    =begin code
    multi sub f() is default { say "Hello there" }
    multi sub f(:$greet) { say "Hello " ~ $greet }
    f();   # "Use of uninitialized value $greet..."
    =end code

In this example, the C<multi> without C<is default> was called because it was
actually narrower than the C<Sub> with it.

Subroutines can also be declared C<anon>. See the L<documentation on the C<anon> declarator|/language/variables#The_anon_declarator> for more information.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method name

    method name(Routine:D: --> Str:D)

Returns the name of the sub or method.

=head2 method package

    method package(Routine:D:)

Returns the package in which the routine is defined.

=head2 method multi

    method multi(Routine:D: --> Bool:D)

Returns C<True> if the routine is a multi sub or method. Note that
the name of a multi sub refers to its proto and this method would
return false if called on it. It needs to be called on the
candidates themselves:

    multi foo ($, $) {};
    say &foo.multi;             # OUTPUT: «False␤»
    say &foo.candidates».multi; # OUTPUT: «(True)␤»

=head2 method candidates

    method candidates(Routine:D: --> Positional:D)

Returns a list of multi candidates, or a one-element list with itself
if it's not a multi

=head2 method cando

    method cando(Capture $c)

Returns a possibly-empty list of candidates that can be called with the
given L<Capture|/type/Capture>, ordered by narrowest candidate first. For
methods, the first element of the Capture needs to be the invocant:

    .signature.say for "foo".^can("comb")[0].cando: \(Cool, "o");
    # OUTPUT: «(Cool $: Str $matcher, $limit = Inf, *%_)␤»

=head2 method wrap

    method wrap(Routine:D: &wrapper)

Wraps (i.e. in-place modifies) the routine. That means a call to this routine
first calls C<&wrapper>, which then can (but doesn't have to) call the
original routine with the C<callsame>, C<callwith>, C<nextsame> and
C<nextwith> dispatchers. The return value from the routine is also
the return value from the wrapper.

C<wrap> returns an instance of a private class called L<WrapHandle|/type/WrapHandle>,
which you can pass to L<unwrap> to restore the original routine.

=head2 method unwrap

    method unwrap($wraphandle)

Restores the original routine after it has been wrapped with L<wrap>. While
the signature allows any type to be passed, only the L<WrapHandle|/type/WrapHandle>
type returned from C<wrap> can usefully be.

=head2 method yada

    method yada(Routine:D: --> Bool:D)

Returns C<True> if the routine is a stub

    say (sub f() { ... }).yada;      # OUTPUT: «True␤»
    say (sub g() { 1;  }).yada;      # OUTPUT: «False␤»

=head2 trait is cached

    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine $r, :$cached!)

B<NOTE:> this feature is currently EXPERIMENTAL.

Causes the return value of a routine to be stored, so that when subsequent
calls with the same list of arguments are made, the stored value can be
returned immediately instead of re-running the routine.

Useful when storing and returning the computed value is much faster than
re-computing it every time, and when the time saving trumps the cost of the
use of more memory.

Even if the arguments passed to the routine are "reference types" (such as
objects or arrays), then for the purpose of caching they will only be compared
based on their contents. Thus the second invocation will hit the cache in this
case:

=for code :skip-test
say foo( [1, 2, 3] );   # runs foo
say foo( [1, 2, 3] );   # doesn't run foo, uses cached value

=begin code
use experimental :cached;

sub nth-prime(Int:D $x where * > 0) is cached {
    say "Calculating {$x}th prime";
    return (2..*).grep(*.is-prime)[$x - 1];
}

say nth-prime(43);
say nth-prime(43);
say nth-prime(43);
=end code

produces this output:

=begin code :skip-test
Calculating 43th prime
191
191
191
=end code

=head2 trait is pure

    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine $r, :$pure!)

Marks a subroutine as I<pure>, that is, it asserts that for the same input, it
will always produce the same output without any additional side effects.

The C<is pure> trait is a promise by the programmer to the compiler that it can
constant-fold calls to such functions when the arguments are known at compile
time.

    sub syllables() is pure {
        say "Generating syllables";
        my @vowels = <a e i o u>;
        return  @vowels.append: <k m n sh d r t y> X~ @vowels;
    }

You can mark function as pure even if they throw exceptions in edge cases
or if they modify temporary objects; hence the C<is pure> trait can cover
cases that the compiler cannot deduce on its own. On the other hand, you might
not want to constant-fold functions that produce a large return value (such
as the string or list repetition operators, infix C<x> and C<xx>) even if they
are pure, to avoid large precompilation files.

To see it an action with a particular compiler you can try this example:

    =begin code :preamble<sub syllables {}>
    BEGIN { say ‘Begin’ }
    say ‘Start’;
    say (^100).map: { syllables().pick(2..5).join("") };


    # Example output:
    # Begin
    # Generating syllables
    # Start
    # (matiroi yeterani shoriyuru...
    =end code


Essentially this allows the compiler to perform some operations at
compile time. The benefits of constant-folding I<may> include better
performance, especially in cases when the folded code is precompiled.

In addition, using a pure function or operator in sink context (that is,
where the result is discarded) may lead to a warning. The code

    sub double($x) is pure { 2 * $x };
    double(21);
    say "anything";
    # WARNING: «Useless use of "double(21)" in expression "double(21)" in sink context (line 2)»

If you want to apply this trait to a C<multi>, you need to apply it to the
C<proto>; it will not work otherwise, at least in versions 2018.08 and below.

=head2 trait is rw

    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine $r, :$rw!)

When a routine is modified with this trait, its return value will be writable.
This is useful when returning variables or writable elements of hashes or
arrays, for example:

=begin code
sub walk(\thing, *@keys) is rw {
    my $current := thing;
    for @keys -> $k {
        if $k ~~ Int {
            $current := $current[$k];
        }
        else {
            $current := $current{$k};
        }
    }
    $current;
}

my %hash;
walk(%hash, 'some', 'key', 1, 2) = 'autovivified';

say %hash.perl;
=end code

produces

=begin code
("some" => {"key" => [Any, [Any, Any, "autovivified"]]}).hash
=end code

Note that C<return> marks return values as read only; if you need an early exit
from an C<is rw> routine, you have to use X<C<return-rw>|return-rw> instead.

=head2 trait is export

    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine $r, :$export!)

Marks a routine as exported to the rest of the world

=begin code :allow<B>
module Foo {
    sub double($x) B<is export> {
        2 * $x
    }
}

import Foo;         # makes sub double available
say double 21;      # 42
=end code

From inside another file you'd say C<use Foo;> to load a module and import the
exported functions.

See L<Exporting and Selective Importing Modules|/language/modules#Exporting_and_selective_importing>
for more details.

=head2 trait is DEPRECATED

    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine:D $r, :$DEPRECATED!)

Marks a routine as deprecated, optionally with a message what to use instead.

This code

=begin code
sub f() is DEPRECATED('the literal 42') { 42 }
say f();
=end code

produces this output:

=begin code :skip-test
42
Saw 1 occurrence of deprecated code.
================================================================================
Sub f (from GLOBAL) seen at:
  deprecated.p6, line 2
Please use the literal 42 instead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please contact the author to have these occurrences of deprecated code
adapted, so that this message will disappear!
=end code

=head2 trait is hidden-from-backtrace

    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine:D, :$hidden-from-backtrace!)

Hides a routine from showing up in a default backtrace. For example

=begin code
sub inner { die "OH NOEZ" };
sub outer { inner() };
outer();
=end code

produces the error message and backtrace

=begin code :skip-test
OH NOEZ
  in sub inner at bt.p6:1
  in sub outer at bt.p6:2
  in block <unit> at bt.p6:3
=end code

but if C<inner> is marked with C<hidden-from-backtrace>

=begin code
sub inner is hidden-from-backtrace { die "OH NOEZ" };
sub outer { inner() };
outer();
=end code

the error backtrace does not show it:

=begin code :skip-test
OH NOEZ
  in sub outer at bt.p6:2
  in block <unit> at bt.p6:3
=end code

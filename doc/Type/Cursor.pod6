=SUBTITLE Internal state of the regex engine during parsing

    class Cursor { }

A C<Cursor> object is used internally by the regex engine in regex matches
to keep track of the current position, backtracking waypoints and information
about capturing groups.

A user-space program usually doesn't need to deal with C<Cursor> objects,
just with their relatives, L<Match|/type/Match> objects.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method actions

    method actions(Cursor:D: --> Mu)

Returns the currently active actions object (or L<Mu|/type/Mu> if none is set).

=head2 method orig

    method orig(Cursor:D: --> Any)

Returns the object against which the regex matches.

=head2 method target

    method target(Cursor:D: --> Str:D)

Returns a string representation of the object against which the regex matches.
This is the value that the regex engine works with internally.

=head2 method pos

    method pos(Cursor:D: --> Int:D)

Returns the current position as a string index into C<Cursor.target>.

=TITLE class Instant

=SUBTITLE Specific moment in time

    class Instant is Cool does Real { }

An C<Instant> is a particular moment in time measured in atomic seconds, with
fractions. It is not tied to or aware of any epoch.

An C<Instant> can be used to create a L<DateTime> object set to that
C<Instant>. The pseudo-constant C<now> returns the current time as an
C<Instant>.

Basic math is defined for C<Instant>s (as well as L<Duration>s). Adding an
C<Instant> to a C<Duration> returns another Instant. Subtracting two C<Instant>s
will yield a C<Duration>. Adding two C<Instant>s is explicitly disallowed. All
other operations with Instants are undefined.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method from-posix

    method from-posix($posix, Bool $prefer-leap-second = False)

Converts the POSIX timestamp C<$posix> to an Instant.
If C<$prefer-leap-second> is C<True>, the return value will be
the first of the two possible seconds in the case of a leap second.

    say DateTime.new(Instant.from-posix(915148800, True));  # 1998-12-31T23:59:60Z
    say DateTime.new(Instant.from-posix(915148800));        # 1999-01-01T00:00:00Z

=head2 method to-posix

    method to-posix()

Converts the invocant to a POSIX timestamp and returns a two
element list containing the POSIX timestamp and a C<Bool>.
It is the inverse of L<#method from-posix>, except that the second return
value is C<True> if *and only if* this Instant is in a leap
second.

    say DateTime.new("1999-01-01T00:00:00Z").Instant.to-posix  # (915148800 False)
    say DateTime.new('1998-12-31T23:59:60Z').Instant.to-posix; # (915148800 True)

=SUBTITLE Error due to a failed type check during assignment

    class X::TypeCheck::Assignment is X::TypeCheck { }

Error class thrown when the type check of an assignment fails.

For example

    my Int $x = "foo"

dies with

    Type check failed in assignment to '$x'; expected 'Int' but got 'Str'

though compilers are allowed to detect obvious cases like this example
and complain at compile time with a different error.

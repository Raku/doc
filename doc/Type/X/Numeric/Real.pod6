=TITLE class X::Numeric::Real

=SUBTITLE Error while trying to coerce a number to a Real type

    class X::Numeric::Real is Exception { }

Occurs when an attempt to coerce a C<Numeric> to a C<Real>, C<Num>, C<Int> or
C<Rat> fails (due to a number with a nonzero imaginary part, for instance).

For example

    say (1+2i).Int;
    CATCH { default { put .^name, ': ', .Str } };
    # OUTPUT: «X::Numeric::Real: Can not convert 1+2i to Int: imaginary part not zero␤»

=head1 Methods

=head2 method source

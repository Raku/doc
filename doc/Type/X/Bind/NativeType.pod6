=SUBTITLE Compilation error due to binding to a natively typed variable

    class X::Bind::NativeType does X::Comp { }

Compile-time error thrown when trying to bind to a natively typed variable.

Since native variables explicitly don't have the concept of a container at
runtime. Thus it does not make sense to support both binding and assignment,
and PerlÂ 6 supports only assignment (which makes more sense, because native
types are value types). So use assignment for natively typed variables.

For example the code

=for code :skip-test
my int $x := 3;

dies with

=for code :skip-test
Cannot bind to natively typed variable '$x'; use assignment instead

and can be fixed by writing it as

    my int $x = 3;

=head1 Methods

=head2 method name

    method name(--> Str:D)

Returns the name of the variable.

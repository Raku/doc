=SUBTITLE Compilation error due to augmenting a type without `MONKEY-TYPING`

    class X::Syntax::Augment::WithoutMonkeyTyping does X::Syntax { }

Compile time error thrown when C<augment> is used without C<use MONKEY-TYPING>.

Since C<augment> is considered a rather unsafe and impolite action, you have
to pre-declare your intent with the C<use MONKEY-TYPING;> pragma.

If you don't do that, for example

    augment class Int { };

you get the error

    ===SORRY!===
    augment not allowed without 'use MONKEY-TYPING'

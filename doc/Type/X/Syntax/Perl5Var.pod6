=SUBTITLE Compilation error due to use of Perl 5-only default variables

    class X::Syntax::Perl5Var does X::Syntax { }

Syntax error thrown when some piece of code tries to use one of the old Perl 5
variables (and it does not error for some other reason).

=for code :skip-test<Throws an exception>
say $];

dies with

=for code :lang<text>
Unsupported use of $] variable; in Raku please use $*PERL.version or $*PERL.compiler.version

For every unsupported variable (which include most C<$^'letter'> constructs,
as well as others like C<$">, the error message will mention that the
variable is unsupported and the equivalent commands you could use.

=SUBTITLE Error due to binding to something that is not a variable or container

    class X::Bind is Exception {}

If you write code like this:

=begin code :skip-test<compile time error>
floor(1.1) := 42;
=end code

it dies with an C<X::Bind> exception:

=begin code :lang<text>
Cannot use bind operator with this left-hand side
=end code

=end pod

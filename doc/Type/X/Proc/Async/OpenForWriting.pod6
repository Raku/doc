=TITLE class X::Proc::Async::OpenForWriting

=SUBTITLE Error due to writing to a read-only Proc::Async object

    class X::Proc::Async::OpenForWriting is Exception {}

When a L<Proc::Async> object is opened only for reading from the external
program (no C<:w> passed to open), and a write operation such as C<write>,
C<print> and C<say> is performed, an exception of type
X<X::Proc::Async::OpenForWriting> is thrown:

    my $proc = Proc::Async.new("echo");
    $proc.start;
    $proc.say(42);
    CATCH { default { put .^name, ': ', .Str } };
    # OUTPUT: «X::Proc::Async::OpenForWriting: Process must be opened for writing with :w to call 'say'␤»

To fix that you can use writable commands with :w flag:

    my $prog = Proc::Async.new(:w, 'cat');
    $prog.stdout.tap( -> $str {
        print $str;
    });
    my $promise = $prog.start;
    await $prog.say('foo');
    $prog.close-stdin;
    await $promise;

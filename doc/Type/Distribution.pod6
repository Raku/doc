=TITLE role Distribution

=SUBTITLE Distribution

    role Distribution { }

Interface for objects that provide API access mapping META6 data to the files
its represents. Objects that fulfill the C<Distribution> role can be read by
e.g. L<CompUnit::Repository::Installation>. Generally a C<Distribution> provides
read access to a set of modules and metadata. These may be backed by the
filesystem (L<Distribution::Path>, L<Distribution::Hash>) but could also read
from a e.g. tar file or socket.

=head1 Required Methods

=head2 method meta

    method meta(--> Hash:D) { ... }

Returns a Hash with the representation of the metadata. Please note that an
actual C<META6.json> file does not need to exist, just a representation in that
format.

=head2 method content

    method content($name-path --> IO::Handle:D) { ... }

Returns an C<IO::Handle> to the file represented by C<$name-path>. C<$name-path>
is a relative path as it would be found in the metadata such as C<lib/Foo.pm6>
or C<resources/foo.txt>.

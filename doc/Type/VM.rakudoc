=head1 Methods


=head2 method osname

    multi method osname(VM:U:)
    multi method osname(VM:D:)

Instance / Class method returning the name of the Operating System, as known
by the configuration of the VM object / currently running virtual machine.

Instance method returning a string of the value of the compilation target
that should be used when precompiling source-files with the VM object.

Instance method returning a string of the path in which the virtual machine

=head2 method request-garbage-collection

Available as of the 2020.05 release of the Rakudo compiler.

Class method that tells the virtual machine on which Raku is running, to
perform a garbage collect run when possible.  Issues a warning if such a
request is not supported by the virtual machine.

Provides no guarantee that the process will actually use less memory after
a garbage collect.  In fact, calling this method repeatedly, may actually
cause more memory to be used due to memory fragmentation.

Mainly intended as a debugging aid for module / core developers.

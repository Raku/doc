=TITLE class Scalar

=SUBTITLE A mostly transparent container used for indirections

    class Scalar {}

A C<Scalar> is an internal indirection, that is, a way to refer indirectly to a
value, which is, for most purposes, invisible during ordinary use of Raku. It is
the default container type associated with the C<$> sigil. A literal C<Scalar>
may be placed around any literal by enclosing the value in C<$(…)>. This
notation will appear in the output of a C<.raku> method in certain places where
it is important to note the presence of C<Scalar>s.

When a value is assigned to a C<$>-sigiled variable, the variable will
actually bind to a C<Scalar>, which in turn will bind to the value.
When a C<Scalar> is assigned to a C<$>-sigiled variable, the value
bound to by that C<Scalar> will be bound to the C<Scalar> which that
variable was bound to (a new one will be created if necessary.)

In addition, C<Scalar>s delegate all method calls to the value which they
contain. As such, C<Scalar>s are for the most part invisible. There is, however,
one important place where C<Scalar>s have a visible impact: a C<Scalar>
container will shield its content from
L<flattening|/language/subscripts#index-entry-flattening_> by most Raku core list
operations.

=for code
say |(1,2,$(3,4));       # OUTPUT: «12(3 4)␤»

These C<Scalar> containers can also be created on the fly by assigning to an
L<anonymous scalar variable|language/variables#index-entry-$_(variable)>:

=for code
say |(1,2, $ = (3,4)); # OUTPUT: «12(3 4)␤»

A C<$>-sigiled variable may be bound directly to a value with no
intermediate C<Scalar> using the binding operator C<:=>. You can
tell if this has been done by examining the output of the
introspective pseudo-method C<.VAR>:

    my $a = 1;
    $a.^name.say;     # OUTPUT: «Int␤»
    $a.VAR.^name.say; # OUTPUT: «Scalar␤»
    my $b := 1;
    $b.^name.say;     # OUTPUT: «Int␤»
    $b.VAR.^name.say; # OUTPUT: «Int␤»

This same thing happens when values are assigned to an element of
an C<Array>, however, C<List>s directly contain their values:

    my @a = 1, 2, 3;
    @a[0].^name.say;            # OUTPUT: «Int␤»
    @a[0].VAR.^name.say;        # OUTPUT: «Scalar␤»
    [1, 2, 3][0].^name.say;     # OUTPUT: «Int␤»
    [1, 2, 3][0].VAR.^name.say; # OUTPUT: «Scalar␤»
    (1, 2, 3)[0].^name.say;     # OUTPUT: «Int␤»
    (1, 2, 3)[0].VAR.^name.say; # OUTPUT: «Int␤»

Array elements may be bound directly to values using C<:=> as well; however,
this is discouraged as it may lead to confusion. Doing so will break exact
round-tripping of C<.raku> output – since C<Array>s are assumed to place
C<Scalar>s around each element, C<Scalar>s are not denoted with C<$> in the
output of C<Array.raku>.

    [1, $(2, 3)].raku.say;     # OUTPUT: «[1, (2, 3)]␤»
    (1, $(2, 3)).raku.say;     # OUTPUT: «(1, $(2, 3))␤»

Binding a C<Scalar> to a C<$>-sigiled variable replaces the existing
C<Scalar> in that variable, if any, with the given C<Scalar>.
That means more than one variable may refer to the same C<Scalar>.
Because the C<Scalar> may be mutated, this makes it possible to
alter the value of both variables by altering only one of them:

    my $a = 1;
    my $b := $a;
    $b = 2;
    $a.say;       # OUTPUT: «2␤»

X<|Syntax,\ (sigilless scalar)>
Raku allows the use of constants with a
L<static single assignment (SSA)|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>
style which bind directly to their value with no intervening C<Scalar>
container, even when assignment (C<=>) is used. They may be forced to use a
C<Scalar> by assigning a C<$>-sigiled variable to them, at which point, they
behave entirely like C<$>-sigiled variables.

    my \c = 1;
    c.^name.say;             # OUTPUT: «Int␤»
    c.VAR.^name.say;         # OUTPUT: «Int␤»
    my $a = 1;
    my \d = $a;              # just "my \d = $ = 1" works, too
    d.^name.say;             # OUTPUT: «Int␤»
    d.VAR.^name.say;         # OUTPUT: «Scalar␤»
    d = 2;                   # ok
    c = 2;                   # fails
    CATCH { default { put .^name, ': ', .Str } };
    # OUTPUT: «X::Assignment::RO: Cannot modify an immutable Int␤»

=head1 Atomic operations on Scalar

A C<Scalar> can have its value changed using a hardware-supported atomic
compare and swap operation. This is useful when implementing lock free data
structures and algorithms. It may also be fetched and assigned to in an
"atomic" fashion, which ensures appropriate memory barriering and prevents
unwanted optimizations of memory accesses.

A C<Scalar> that will be used with an atomic operation should B<always> be
explicitly initialized with a value before any atomic operations are
performed upon it. This is to avoid races with lazy allocation and
auto-vivification. For example:

=for code :preamble<no strict;>
cas(@a[5], $expected, $value)

Will work in principle since an C<Array> consists of C<Scalar> containers.
However, the container is only bound into the array upon initial assignment.
Therefore, there would be a race to do that binding. The C<Scalar> atomic
operations will never check for or do any such auto-vivification, so as to
make such bugs much more evident (rather than only observed under stress).

=head1 Introspection

=head2 method of

    method of(Scalar:D: --> Mu)

Returns the type constraint of the container.

Example:

    my Cool $x = 42;
    say $x.VAR.of;                  # OUTPUT: «(Cool)»

=head2 method default

    method default(Scalar:D: --> Str)

Returns the default value associated with the container.

Example:

    my $x is default(666) = 42;
    say $x.VAR.default;             # OUTPUT: «666»

=head2 method name

    method name(Scalar:D: --> Str)

Returns the name associated with the container.

Example:

    my $x = 42;
    say $x.VAR.name;                # OUTPUT: «$x»

=head2 method dynamic

    method dynamic(Scalar:D: --> Bool)

It will return C<False> for scalars.

Example:

    my $*FOO = 42;
    say $*FOO.VAR.dynamic;          # OUTPUT: «True»

Note that you have to use the C<VAR> method in order to get that information.

    my $s is dynamic = [1, 2, 3];
    say $s.dynamic;                          # OUTPUT: «False␤»  (wrong, don't do this)
    say $s.VAR.dynamic;                      # OUTPUT: «True␤»   (correct approach)

=head1 Routines

=head2 sub atomic-assign

    multi sub atomic-assign($target is rw, $value)

Performs an atomic assignment of C<$value> into the C<Scalar> C<$target>. The
C<atomic-assign> routine ensures that any required barriers are performed such
that the changed value will be "published" to other threads.

=head2 sub atomic-fetch

    multi sub atomic-fetch($target is rw)

Performs an atomic read of the value in the C<Scalar> C<$target> and returns
the read value. Using this routine instead of simply using the variable
ensures that the latest update to the variable from other threads will be seen,
both by doing any required hardware barriers and also preventing the compiler
from lifting reads. For example:

    my $started = False;
    start { atomic-assign($started, True) }
    until atomic-fetch($started) { }

Is certain to terminate, while in:

    my $started = False;
    start { atomic-assign($started, True) }
    until $started { }

It would be legal for a compiler to observe that C<$started> is not updated in
the loop, and so lift the read out of the loop, thus causing the program to
never terminate.

=head2 sub cas

    multi sub cas(Mu $target is rw, Mu \expected, Mu \value)
    multi sub cas(Mu $target is rw, &operation)

Performs an atomic compare and swap of the value in the C<Scalar> C<$target>.
The first form has semantics like:

=for code :preamble<no strict;>
my $seen = $target;
if $seen<> =:= $expected<> {
    $target = $value;
}
return $seen;

Except it is performed as a single hardware-supported atomic instruction, as
if all memory access to C<$target> were blocked while it took place. Therefore
it is safe to attempt the operation from multiple threads without any other
synchronization. Since it is a reference comparison, this operation is usually
not sensible on value types.

For example:

    constant NOT_STARTED = Any.new;
    constant STARTED = Any.new;
    my $master = NOT_STARTED;
    await start {
        if cas($master, NOT_STARTED, STARTED) === NOT_STARTED {
            say "Master!"
        }
    } xx 4

Will reliably only ever print C<Master!> one time, as only one of the threads
will be successful in changing the C<Scalar> from C<NOT_STARTED> to
C<STARTED>.

The second form, taking a code object, will first do an atomic fetch of the
current value and invoke the code object with it. It will then try to do an
atomic compare and swap of the target, using the value passed to the code
object as C<expected> and the result of the code object as C<value>. If
this fails, it will read the latest value, and retry, until a CAS operation
succeeds.

Therefore, an item could be added to the head of a linked list in a lock free
manner as follows:

    class Node {
        has $.value;
        has Node $.next;
    }
    my Node $head = Node;
    await start {
        for ^1000 -> $value {
            cas $head, -> $next { Node.new(:$value, :$next) }
        }
    } xx 4;

This will reliably build up a linked list of 4000 items, with 4 nodes with
each value ranging from 0 up to 999.

B<Note>: Before Rakudo version 2020.12, C<$target>, C<expected> and
C<value> had an L«C<Any>|/type/Any» type constraint.

=head1 Operators

=head2 infix ⚛=

    multi sub infix:<⚛=>($target is rw, $value)

Performs an atomic assignment of C<$value> into the C<Scalar> C<$target>. The
C<⚛=> operator ensures that any required barriers are performed such that the
changed value will be "published" to other threads.

=head2 prefix ⚛

    multi sub prefix:<⚛>($target is rw)

Performs an atomic read of the value in the C<Scalar> C<$target> and returns
the read value. Using this operator instead of simply using the variable
ensures that the latest update to the variable from other threads will be seen,
both by doing any required hardware barriers and also preventing the compiler
from lifting reads. For example:

    my $started = False;
    start { $started ⚛= True }
    until ⚛$started { }

Is certain to terminate, while in:

    my $started = False;
    start { $started ⚛= True }
    until $started { }

It would be legal for a compiler to observe that C<$started> is not updated in
the loop, and so lift the read out of the loop, thus causing the program to
never terminate.

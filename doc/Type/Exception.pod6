=TITLE class Exception

=SUBTITLE Anomalous event capable of interrupting normal control-flow

    class Exception {}

All exceptions that are placed into the C<$!> variable (or into C<$_>
in C<CATCH> blocks) inherit from C<Exception>. When you call C<die>
or C<fail> with a non-Exception argument, it is wrapped into an
C<X::AdHoc> object, which also inherits from C<Exception>.

User-defined exception classes should inherit from C<Exception> too, and
define at least a method C<message>.

    class X::YourApp::SomeError is Exception {
        method message() {
            "A YourApp-Specific error occurred: out of coffee!";
        }
    }

=head1 Methods

=head2 method message

Defined as:

    method message(Exception:D:) returns Str:D

This is a stub that must be overwritten by subclasses, and should
return the exception message.

Special care should be taken that this method does not produce
an exception itself.

    try die "Something bad happened";
    if ($!) {
        say $!.message; # Something bad happened.
    }

=head2 method backtrace

Defined as:

    method backtrace(Exception:D:) returns Backtrace:D

Returns the backtrace associated with the exception. Only makes sense
on exceptions that have been thrown at least once.

    try die "Something bad happened";
    if ($!) {
        say $!.backtrace;
    }

=head2 method throw

Defined as:

    method throw(Exception:D:)

Throws the exception.

    my $exception = X::AdHoc.new; # Totally fine
    try $exception.throw;             # Throws
    if ($!) { #`( some handling ) };                   # Suppress the exception in a

=head2 method resume

Defined as:

    method resume(Exception:D:)

Resumes control flow where C<.throw> left it when handled in a C<CATCH> block.

    # For example, resume control flow for any exception
    CATCH { default { .resume } }

=head2 method rethrow

Defined as:

    method rethrow(Exception:D:)

Rethrows an exception that has already been thrown at least once.
This is different from C<throw> in that it preserves the original
backtrace.

    my $e = X::AdHoc.new(payload => "Bad situation");
    sub f() { die 'Bad' };
    sub g() { try f; CATCH { default { .rethrow } } };
    g;
    CATCH { default { say .backtrace.full } };

=head2 method fail

Defined as:

    multi sub    fail(*@text)
    multi sub    fail(Exception $e)
    multi method fail(Exception:D $e:)

Exits the calling C<Routine> and returns a L<Failure> object wrapping the
exception C<$e> - or, for the C<*@text> form, an L<X::AdHoc> exception
constructed from the concatenation of C<@text>. If the caller
activated fatal exceptions via the pragma C<use fatal;>, the exception is
thrown instead of being returned as a C<Failure>.

    sub copy-directory-tree ($dir) {
        fail "$dir is not a directory" if !$dir.IO.d;
        ...
    }

=head2 method gist

Defined as:

    multi method gist(Exception:D:)

Returns whatever the exception printer should produce for this exception.
The default implementation returns message and backtrace separated by
a newline.

    my $e = X::AdHoc.new(payload => "This exception is pretty bad");
    try $e.throw;
    if ($!) { say $!.gist; };
    # OUTPUT: «This exception is pretty bad
    #   in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1␤»

=head2 sub die

Defined as:

    multi sub die(*@message)
    multi sub die(Exception:D $e)
    method    die(Exception:D $e)

Throws a fatal C<Exception>. The default exception handler prints each
element of the list to C<$*ERR> (STDERR).

=for code :skip-test
die "Important reason";

=head2 sub warn

Defined as:

    multi sub warn(*@message)

Throws a resumable warning exception, which is considered a control
exception, and hence is invisible to most normal exception handlers.  The
outermost control handler will print the warning to C<$*ERR>. After printing
the warning, the exception is resumed where it was thrown.  To override this
behavior, catch the exception in a C<CONTROL> block.  A C<quietly {...}>
block is the opposite of a C<try {...}> block in that it will suppress any
warnings but pass fatal exceptions through.

To simply print to C<$*ERR>, please use C<note> instead.  C<warn> should be
reserved for use in threatening situations when you don't quite want to
throw an exception.

    warn "Warning message";

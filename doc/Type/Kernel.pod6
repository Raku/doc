L<name|/routine/name>.

=head2 method auth

    method auth(--> Str)

Instance method returning the "auth" (as in "author" or "authority") of the
Kernel object.  Returns "unknown" if the "auth" could not be established.

=head2 method bits

the program (in microseconds).

=head2 method desc

    method desc(--> Str)

Instance method returning the "desc" (as in "description") of the Kernel object.
Returns a C<Str> type object if the "desc" could not be established.

=head2 method endian

=head2 method signals

Instance method returning a list of C<Signal>s that are supported by the
kernel represented by the Kernel object.

=head2 method signature

Instance method returning the signature of the Kernel object.  Returns a
C<Blob> type object if the signature could not be established.

=head2 method version

    method version(--> Version)

=TITLE role Callable

=SUBTITLE Invocable code object

    role Callable { ... }

Role for objects which support calling them. It's used in L<Block|/type/Block>,
L<Routine|/type/Routine>, L<Sub|/type/Sub>, L<Method|/type/Method>, L<Submethod|/type/Submethod> and L<Macro|/type/Macro> types.

Callables can be stored in C<&>-sigiled containers, the default type constraint
of such a container is C<Callable>.
=comment A signature object can be used to
=comment force a check against the signature of the Callable to be stored into the
=comment container.

    my &a = {;}; # Empty block needs a semicolon
    my &b = -> {};
    my &c = sub () {};
    sub foo() {};
    my &d = &foo;
=comment commented out until it's implemented for code :skip-test
=comment my &f:(Int) = sub bar(Int) {}; # Not yet implemented
=comment my &f:(Str) = -> Str {};       # Not yet implemented

=head1 Methods

=head2 method CALL-ME

    method CALL-ME(Callable:D $self: |arguments)

This method is required for postfix:«( )» and postfix:«.( )». It's what makes
an object actually call-able and needs to be overloaded to let a given object
act like a routine. If the object needs to be stored in a C<&>-sigiled
container, is has to implement Callable.

    class A does Callable {
        submethod CALL-ME(|c){ 'called' }
    }
    my &a = A;
    say a(); # OUTPUT: «called␤»

=head2 method Capture

Defined as:

    method Capture()

Throws C<X::Cannot::Capture>.

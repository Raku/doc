=TITLE class MixHash

=SUBTITLE Mutable collection of distinct objects with Real weights

    class MixHash does Mixy { }

A C<MixHash> is a mutable mix, meaning a collection of distinct elements in no
particular order that each have a real-number weight assigned to them. (For
I<immutable> mixes, see L<Mix> instead.)

Objects/values of any type are allowed as mix elements. Within a C<MixHash>,
items that would compare positively with the L<===> operator are considered the
same element, with a combined weight.

=begin code
my $recipe = (butter => 0.22, sugar => 0.1,
              flour => 0.275, sugar => 0.02).MixHash;

say $recipe.elems;      # OUTPUT: «3␤»
say $recipe.keys.sort;  # OUTPUT: «butter flour sugar␤»
say $recipe.pairs.sort; # OUTPUT: «"butter" => 0.22 "flour" => 0.275 "sugar" => 0.12␤»
say $recipe.total;      # OUTPUT: «0.615␤»
=end code

C<MixHash>es can be treated as object hashes using the C<{ }> postcircumfix
operator, which returns the corresponding numeric weight for keys that are
elements of the mix, and C<0> for keys that aren't. It can also be used to modify
weights; Setting a weight to C<0> automatically removes that element from the
mix, and setting a weight to a non-zero number adds that element if it didn't
already exist:

=begin code
my $recipe = (butter => 0.22, sugar => 0.1,
              flour => 0.275, sugar => 0.02).MixHash;

say $recipe<butter>;     # OUTPUT: «0.22␤»
say $recipe<sugar>;      # OUTPUT: «0.12␤»
say $recipe<chocolate>;  # OUTPUT: «0␤»

$recipe<butter> = 0;
$recipe<chocolate> = 0.30;
say $recipe.pairs;       # OUTPUT: «"sugar" => 0.12 "flour" => 0.275 "chocolate" => 0.3␤»
=end code


=head1 Creating C<MixHash> objects

C<MixHash>es can be composed using C<MixHash.new>. Any positional parameters,
regardless of their type, become elements of the mix - with a weight of C<1> for
each time the parameter occurred:

    my $n = MixHash.new: "a", "a", "b" => 0, "c" => 3.14;
    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Str) (Pair) (Pair))␤»
    say $n.pairs;            # OUTPUT: «(a => 2 (c => 3.14) => 1 (b => 0) => 1)␤»

Alternatively, the C<.MixHash> coercer (or its functional form, C<MixHash()>)
can be called on an existing object to coerce it to a C<MixHash>. Its semantics
depend on the type and contents of the object. In general it evaluates the
object in list context and creates a mix with the resulting items as elements,
although for Hash-like objects or Pair items, only the keys become elements of
the mix, and the (cumulative) values become the associated numeric weights:

    my $n = ("a", "a", "b" => 0, "c" => 3.14).MixHash;
    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Str) (Str))␤»
    say $n.pairs;            # OUTPUT: «(a => 2 c => 3.14)␤»

=head1 Operators

=begin comment

TODO: Expand this section (using the corresponding section in
lib/Type/BagHash.pod as a guide) after ab5tract's set/bag/mix operator redesign.

=end comment

See L<Set/Bag Operators|/language/setbagmix#Set/Bag_Operators> for a complete list of set and bag operators
with detailed explanations.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method Bag

Defined as:

    method Bag (--> Bag:D)

Coerces the C<MixHash> to a L«C<Bag>|/type/Bag». The weights are convert to L«C<Int>|/type/Int»,
which means the number of keys in the resulting C<Bag> can be fewer than in the
original C<MixHash>, if any of the weights are negative or truncate to zero.

=head2 method BagHash

Defined as:

    method BagHash (--> BagHash:D)

Coerces the C<MixHash> to a L«C<BagHash>|/type/BagHash». The weights are convert to L«C<Int>|/type/Int»,
which means the number of keys in the resulting C<BagHash> can be fewer than in the
original C<MixHash>, if any of the weights are negative or truncate to zero.

=head1 Note on C<reverse> and ordering

This method is inherited from L<Any|/type/Any#routine_reverse>, however, C<Mix>es do not have an inherent order and you should not trust it returning a consistent output.

# Official Documentation of Perl 6

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/perl6/doc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/perl6/doc) [![artistic](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Artistic%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-2.0)

[![Run Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/591e99923f2f790700098a30/badge?branch=master)](https://app.shippable.com/github/perl6/doc)

An HTML version of this documentation can be found at [https://docs.perl6.org/](https://docs.perl6.org/).
This is currently the recommended way to consume the documentation.

There is also a command line tool called "p6doc".

(If you are browsing this repository via GitHub, it will not display most
files correctly, because this is Perl 6 Pod, and GitHub assumes Perl 5 Pod).

## README in other languages

* [README in Chinese](README.zh.md)
* [README in Dutch](README.nl.md)
* [README in French](README.fr.md)
* [README in German](README.de.md)
* [README in Italian](README.it.md)
* [README in Japanese](README.jp.md)
* [README in Portuguese](README.pt.md)
* [README in Spanish](README.es.md)

## Install p6doc

This module is available via the Perl 6 module ecosystem. Use:

    $ zef install p6doc

to install the binaries and make it available in your binaries
execution path.

## Use p6doc

With a Rakudo `perl6` executable in the `PATH`, try:

    $ ./bin/p6doc Str

to see the documentation for class `Str`, or:

    $ ./bin/p6doc Str.split

to see the documentation for method `split` in class `Str`. You can
skip the `./bin` part if you have installed it via
`zef`. You can also do:

    $ p6doc -f slurp

to browse the documentation of standard functions. Depending on your
disk speed and Rakudo version, it might take a while.

-------

## Building the HTML documentation

Install dependencies by running the following in the checkout directory:

    $ zef --deps-only install .

If you use [`rakudobrew`](https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew), also run the
following, to update the shims for installed executables:

    $ rakudobrew rehash

In addition to the Perl 6 dependencies, you need to have `graphviz` installed, which
on Debian you can do by running:

    $ sudo apt-get install graphviz

To build the documentation web pages, simply run:

    $ make html

Please note that you will need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
installed to produce HTML content with the above command, in particular
a `node` executable should be in your `PATH`. Besides, you will need
to have `g++` installed in order to build some of the dependencies
that are installed with nodejs. nodejs is needed only to apply
highlighting to the included code; if you do not want that, simply
write

    $ make html-nohighlight

After the pages have been generated, you can view them on your local
computer by starting the included `app.pl` program:

    $ make run

You can then view the examples documentation by pointing your web browser at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You will need at least [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious)
installed and you will need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) to perform
highlighting. There are also some additional modules you might need;
install them all using:

    $ cpanm --installdeps .

## Help Wanted!

Perl 6 is not a small language, and documenting it takes a lot of effort.
Any help is appreciated.

Here are some ways to help us:

 * Add missing documentation for classes, roles, methods or operators.
 * Add usage examples to existing documentation.
 * Proofread and correct the documentation.
 * Tell us about missing documentation by opening issues on Github.
 * Do a `git grep TODO` in this repository, and replace the TODO items by
   actual documentation.

[Issues page](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues) has a list of current issues and
documentation parts that are known to be missing
and [the CONTRIBUTING document](CONTRIBUTING.md)
explains briefly how to get started contributing documentation.

--------

## Some notes:

**Q:** Why aren't you embedding the docs in the CORE sources?<br>
**A:** Several reasons:

  1. This documentation is intended to be universal with
     respect to a given version of the specification,
     and not necessarily tied to any specific Perl 6
     implementation.
  2. Implementations' handling of embedded Pod is still
     a bit uneven; this avoids potential runtime impacts.
  3. A separate repo in the perl6 Github account invites
     more potential contributors and editors.

**Q:** Should I include methods from superclasses or roles?<br>
**A:** No. The HTML version already includes methods from superclasses and
       roles, and the `p6doc` script will be taught about those as well.

## Vision

> I want p6doc and docs.perl6.org to become the No. 1 resource to consult
> when you want to know something about a Perl 6 feature, be it from the
> language, or built-in types and routines. I want it to be useful to every
> Perl 6 programmer.

# ENV VARS

- `P6_DOC_TEST_VERBOSE` to a true value to display verbose messages during test suite run.
Helpful when debugging failing test suite.
- `P6_DOC_TEST_FUDGE` fudges `skip-test` code examples as TODO in `xt/examples-compilation.t` test.

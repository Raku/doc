An HTML version of this documentation can be found
at [https://docs.raku.org/](https://docs.raku.org/).
That site is updated from the main branch here
frequently (but not continuously).

This is currently the recommended way to consume the documentation. The tooling
to build and run this site is [available on github](https://github.com/Raku/doc-website).

## Why aren't the docs embedded in the compiler source?

  1. This documentation is intended to be universal with
     respect to the specification, and not tied to any specific
     implementation.
  2. Implementations' handling of embedded Pod is still
     a bit uneven; this avoids potential runtime impacts.
  3. A separate repo in the Raku Github account invites
     more potential contributors and editors.

## rakudoc

There is a [CLI](https://github.com/Raku/rakudoc) for viewing Raku documentation.

## Vision

> I want p6doc and docs.raku.org to become the No. 1 resource to consult
> when you want to know something about a Raku feature, be it from the
> language, or built-in types and routines. I want it to be useful to every
> Raku programmer.

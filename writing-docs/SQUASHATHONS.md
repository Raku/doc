# Squashathon HOW TO

[SQUASHathons](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day) happen monthly in the PerlÂ 6 community, with every other one devoted to this repository. It will help the organization of the hackathon if you follow these rules when participating in it.

1. Always work against an issue. If you find some typo or any other kind of error for which an issue does not exist, please create one.
2. Always work on assigned issues. Assignments get echoed in the [`perl6` IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6), so everyone knows someone is working on that.
3. You can only assign issues to contributors, so if someone who is not a contributor asks to be assigned something to a contributor, please assign it to yourself and do an `@` mention in the issue to the person that is actually doing the work.
4. Start by solving one of the [good first issues](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Leave other ones till the end of the day (so that others can start with something easy too). If you are already experienced, don't be afraid to tackle other, more difficult, issues, starting with [the oldest](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues?page=10&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).
